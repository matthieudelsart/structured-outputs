Team | % of 3 points Raptors | 51% Bucks | 56% Player | DeMar DeRozan and Terrence Ross combined for a whopping 55 points on 17 - of - 28 shooting, helping lead the Raptors to outstanding 51 and 56 percent success rates from the field and three - point range, respectively. Kyle Lowry went for 18 points, while DeMarre Carroll supplied 13 points of his own. Jonas Valanciunas registered an 11 - point, 13 - rebound double - double. The top - heavy Bucks got their own stellar 30 - point performance from Giannis Antetokounmpo, while Jabari Parker followed with 27 points. However, only one other Bucks player managed to get into double digits in the scoring column, and that effort came from the bench in the person of Greg Monroe (11 points). Tony Snell (eight points), John Henson (seven points) and Matthew Dellavedova (two points) considerably underwhelmed, while Milwaukee particularly struggled from long range, shooting just 17 percent from beyond the arc.

The Chicago Bulls (32 - 20) defeated the Orlando Magic (16 - 38) 98 - 97 on Sunday at the Amway Center in Orlando. Down 97 - 96 with just under 10 seconds left in the game, Pau Gasol was able to to throw down a dunk to put the Bulls up one. The Magic went to Nikola Vucevic for the game winner, but he was n't able to convert, giving the Bulls the narrow victory on the road in Orlando. While the Magic were able to out - rebound the Bulls 45 - 35, they were forced into 18 turnovers, which may have been just enough to push the Bulls to win number 32 on the season and keep them a half game ahead of the Cleveland Cavaliers in the Central Division. The Bulls saw huge games from both Jimmy Butler and Gasol. Butler was all over the place, recording a team - high of 27 points (9 - 16 FG, 3 - 4 3Pt, 6 - 6 FT), to go along with five assists and an impressive six steals.

Gasol, on the other hand, posted 25 points (10 - 16 FG, 5 - 6 FT) and 15 rebounds in 37 minutes. It was his twelfth double - double in a row, pushing his season averages to 18 points and 12 rebounds per game. While slightly over - shadowed by the performances of Butler and Gasol, Joakim Noah had a large impact on this game. He finished with 18 points (7 - 10 FG, 4 - 4 FT), nine rebounds and two steals. It matched a season - high in points for him as well and was great for his confidence offensively, as he had combinded for only three points over his last two games. Derrick Rose notched a double - double with 10 points (4 - 14 FG, 1 - 4 3Pt, 1 - 2 FT) and 11 assists. The Magic saw six players reach double figures in points, including all five of their starters, but still were n't able to hold off the Bulls. Victor Oladipo finished with a team - high of 18 points (8 - 16 FG, 1 - 3 3Pt, 1 - 1 FT), while also adding six assists and two steals. He continues to make a nice contribution defensively, as it was his third straight game recording two steals. He's now averaging 17 points, 4 rebounds and 4 assists on the year. Tobias Harris nearly recorded a double - double, posting 15 points (6 - 17 FG, 4 - 4 FT), eight rebounds and three steals. He continues to make a nice contribution defensively, as it was his third straight game recording two steals. He's now averaging 17 points, 4 rebounds and 4 assists on the year.

The Sacramento Kings (6 - 4) defeated the San Antonio Spurs (5 - 4) 94 - 91 on Saturday. Sacramento lost three straight games coming into their matchup with the Spurs, and it was starting to appear as though their hot start to the season was simply a streak of good luck. However, with a win over the NBA champions, the Kings have shown that they're going to try and earnestly fight for a playoff spot this season. They missed all 12 of their three - point attempts in this game, but the inside work of DeMarcus Cousins, Rudy and Darren Collison was enough to carry the team. Sacramento will host the New Orleans Pelicans on Tuesday for their next game. San Antonio saw their three - game win streak come to an end Saturday. If there's a singular reason the Spurs lost, the finger should be pointed at the 16 points they allowed the Kings to score off of 14 turnovers. San Antonio will host the winless Philadelphia 76ers on Monday. Gasol (Kings) 4 97 29 15

The Golden State Warriors (56 - 6) defeated the Orlando Magic (27 - 35) 119 - 113 at Oracle Arena on Monday. The Warriors set an NBA record after capturing their 45th straight home win, and maintained keeping another record alive, as they avoided losing back - to - back games on consecutive days, which has never been done in a regular season. After the shock defeat against the Lakers on Sunday, where the Warriors shot a disastrous 4 - of - 30 from behind the arc, Steph Curry and company bounced back to keep the surging Spurs in the Western Conference at bay for now. Curry scored 41 points, to go along with 13 rebounds and three assists on 14 - of - 24 shooting. Any doubts of the reigning MVP’s ability were erased just 24 hours later. Golden State shot 16 - of - 35 from deep, and bounced back in resilient fashion. Draymond Green is in a shooting slump, and although his one point in the contest is a cause for concern, his court vision and rebounding are certainly in tact, as he spaced the floor and totaled nine rebounds and 10 assists. Klay Thompson aided Curry in the scoring department and finished with 27 points, while Brandon Rush led the bench with 11 points on 3 - of - 5 shooting from behind the arc. The Magic were kept out of the game until Victor Oladipo’s hero effort fell just short in the scorching hot fourth quarter. Down double figures through most of the game, Oladipo rallied his unit with the help of Evan Fournier and Brandon Jennings to outscore the Warriors 36 - 25 in the final period. Oladipo pulled the game within two points after driving the lane for a nice finish at the rim and following up with two free throws on the next possession, but the splash brothers were having none of the Orlando comeback, as Thompson buried a three pointer and Curry sank a pair of clutch free throws. Oladipo finished with 19 points, nine rebounds and eight assists on 8 - of - 16 shooting in 24 minutes off the bench. The Magic will play the second game of a back - to - back when they visit the Los Angeles Lakers (13 - 51) on Tuesday, while the Warriors will host the Utah Jazz (29 - 33) on Wednesday. tables: The text consists of two tables.

The Golden State Warriors (50 - 5) earned an interconference road win Monday night over the Atlanta Hawks (31 - 27) at Phillips Arena, 102 - 92. Even though their shooting was n't as crisp as usual - - 44 percent from the floor, 31 percent from three - point land - - Golden State still ran efficient offense, as they assisted on 30 of their 39 made field goals (77 percent) and turned the ball over just 13 times. The Warriors made 14 of 45 three - pointers (31 percent) and attempted fewer two - pointers (44) than threes. Stephen Curry notched eight assists and six rebounds in addition to leading all scorers with 36 points on an absurdly efficient 14 - 22 shooting night, including 5 - 11 from three. Klay Thompson added 27 points (10 - 23 FG, 5 - 14 3PT) as the Warriors' starting backcourt outscored the Hawks starting guards 53 - 18. Harrison Barnes was the only other Warrior to reach double figures, as he scored 14 on 5 - 8 shooting. Al Horford was a beast inside in the losing effort, as the Hawks center notched 23 points (10 - 20 FG), 16 rebounds, six assists and five blocks. Dennis Schroder came off the bench to score 18 points (8 - 12 FG) in just 18 minutes, and Jeff Teague scored 16 points and added six assists. But the Hawks just could n't find their shot, as they made just 42 percent of their field goals and shot 10 - 34 (29 percent) from three - point land. The Warriors continue their road trip Wednesday against the Heat. The Hawks welcome the Bulls for a Friday contest.

In fact, this is the third straight game in which that has happened. Ricky Rubio tallied just five points and five assists in the loss and he has yet to reach double - digits in scoring, assisting or rebounding this season. Andrew Wiggins put up a rare line in this game, scoring 29 points and failing to record anything else but one rebound and one block. There was a 29 - point swing in this game, as the Timberwolves led by 19 in the first half, while the Kings took a 10 - point in the second half. These two teams will have a rematch in Minneapolis on Dec. 23 for their next meeting.

Gordon Hayward's earlier - than - anticipated return saw him rattle off a team - high 28 points, despite the fact that he drained only six of 17 field - goal attempts. He remained aggressive throughout, however, resulting in 14 visits to the free - throw line that helped boost his scoring total significantly. The entire Jazz first unit had the hot hand, as they shot 55 percent (32 - of - 58) as a group, with all five players hitting double digits on the scoreboard. The Knicks put on an impressive offensive performance themselves, tallying a 51 percent success rate from the field. Carmelo Anthony and Kristaps Porzingis combined for 56 points, with each player compiling half, and also had 17 rebounds between them. Derrick Rose registered 18 points, but scoring was scarce from the rest of the roster, with the remaining seven players totaling just 35 points.

The Philadelphia 76ers (9 - 56) came one step closer to reaching double - digit wins for the season on Friday night, beating the Eastern Conference's 14th - ranked team, the Brooklyn Nets (18 - 47), 95 - 89. The Sixers learned this afternoon that standout rookie Jahlil Okafor will likely miss the remainder of the season due to a torn right meniscus. This was a crushing blow for the already struggling team, as Okafor had been the team's leading scorer up until this point. His absence did not seem to present too much of an issue, however, as it gave sophomore big man Nerlens Noel the chance to take the reigns. Noel stuffed the stat sheet for 13 points, 11 rebounds, three blocks, and two steals. Point guard Ish Smith also impressed, approaching a triple - double with 10 points, seven rebounds, and nine assists. The Nets continued to rely heavily on stars Brook Lopez and Thaddeus Young, who scored 24 and 21 points respectively. Young also pulled down nine rebounds and Lopez had three blocks in what was a solid showing for the powerhouse frontcourt. The rest of the team, however, has suffered largely from injuries and lack of veteran experience throughout the season, and it showed on Friday. The Brooklyn bench went a combined 5 - for - 20 from the field with multiple players scoring no points in over 10 minutes played. The team as a whole shot just 38 percent from the floor, as they could not seem to find the basket whatsoever. Philadelphia will take on Detroit on Sunday for the second half of a back - to - back. The Nets, meanwhile, will see Milwaukee on Monday.

The Celtics were expected to win this game easily, but the Knicks had other ideas. The rebounding differential was glaring to say the least, with New York winning that battle, 58 - 33. The bench production was a huge part of that, with New York's bench grabbing 33 rebounds, while Boston's bench snatched down just eight boards. New York shot over 50 percent from the field, while Boston could n't crack 39 percent. Derrick Rose was at MVP form, as he accumulated 30 points, 10 rebounds, five assists, two steals and two blocks in the win. Willy Hernangonez was huge off the bench, providing 17 points and 11 rebounds. Mindaugas Kuzminskas also scored 17, with Carmelo Anthony and Justin Holiday scoring 13 a piece. Isaiah Thomas carried the load for Boston, collecting 39 points, three rebounds and two assists. Al Horford did provide five points, seven rebounds and 10 assists, but went just 2 - of - 14 from the field. The Celtics were expected to win this game easily, but the Knicks had other ideas.

<NEWLINE> The Oklahoma City Thunder (14 - 8) took down the Atlanta Hawks (14 - 10) by a 107 - 94 final score Thursday night at the Chesapeake Energy Arena. The Thunder rode a 35 - point first quarter to an early lead and never trailed in the final three quarters as the home squad shot the lights out. Oklahoma City shot a pristine 49 percent from the floor and 53 percent (9 - 17) from three - point land, an efficient attack that was too much for the Hawks to handle. The Hawks hit 10 threes of their own, but were manhandled on the boards, as the Thunder won the rebounding battle 52 - 34. Kevin Durant notched a triple - double for the Thunder as he dropped 25 points, 12 rebounds and 10 assists on Atlanta. Russell Westbrook and Serge Ibaka scored 23 points each and both tallied double - doubles, as Westbrook distributed 10 assists and Ibaka pulled down 10 rebounds. Kent Bazemore did what he could off the bench to keep the Hawks in it, as he knocked down 22 points on a smooth 7 - 12 shooting night, including four three - pointers. Jeff Teague led Hawks starters with 18 points, while Al Horford suffered a terrible 3 - 14 shooting night and managed just nine points and seven rebounds. Paul Millsap also could n't get it going, as he managed only seven points on five field goal attempts over 33 minutes of action. The Hawks will face the Spurs on Saturday back in Atlanta in a marquee inter - conference matchup. The Thunder will go on the road to Utah for a Friday night game as they try to extend their winning streak to four.

Milwaukee's stifling defense held the Bulls to a season - low scoring total, while also limiting them to a 30 percent success rate from the field. Giannis Antetokounmpo led the way with a 22 - point, 11 - assist double - double, while Jabari Parker managed 12 points. John Henson and Tony Snell posted a pair of 10 - point efforts, and Greg Monroe came off the bench to tally a 14 - point, 12 - rebound double - double over 23 minutes. A nightmarish outing for the Bulls saw Dwyane Wade pace them in scoring with a modest 12 points, while Taj Gibson and Robin Lopez posted a pair of eight - point tallies on a combined 7 - of - 20 shooting. Jimmy Butler and Rajon Rondo had matching seven - point contributions. Bobby Portis actually served as the second - leading scorer on the team despite coming off the bench, posting 10 points and eight rebounds in 19 minutes.
