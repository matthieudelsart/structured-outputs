Ersan Ilyasova missed a wide - open, game - winning three - pointer at the buzzer. The Pelicans claimed the eight seed in the Western Conference, holding the tiebreaker over the Oklahoma City Thunder, who possess the same record. This was the last time the Pelicans face an Eastern Conference squad, increasing difficulty of retaining that playoff spot. Anthony Davis left briefly in the fourth quarter with an apparent leg injury. He returned moments later after receiving treatment on the sideline. In 42 minutes, Davis finished with 20 points, 12 rebounds, four assists, three blocks and one steal. Tyreke Evans scored 10 of his 12 points in the first quarter, combined with 10 rebounds, six assists and one steal in 37 minutes. Quincy Pondexter provided 18 points and five three - pointers. The Bucks lost their third straight and eight of their last ten. They maintain a three and a half game lead over the Indiana Pacers and Miami Heat for the six seed. Michael Carter-Williams shot 2 - of - 12 in his return to the lineup after missing one game due to an ankle injury. Jerryd Bayless played 34 minutes off the bench following three missed games with his own ankle injury, supplying 14 points, eight rebounds and five assists. Jared Dudley (back) and O. J. Mayo (hamstring) didn’t play the first night of a back - to - back, and Miles Plumlee received a DNP-CD as coach Jason Kidd preferred his eight - man rotation. John Henson recorded four of the Bucks’ 12 blocks. The Pelicans begin a three - game road trip Thursday against the Phoenix Suns.

Die Pelicans erreichten den achten Setzplatz in der Western Conference in der Entscheidung gegen die Oklahoma City Thunder, die dieselben Statistiken aufweisen. Dies war das letzte Spiel der Pelicans gegen eine Mannschaft aus der Eastern Conference, was es schwieriger macht, am Playoff-Platz festzuhalten. Anthony Davis verließ wegen einer anscheinenden Beinverletzung im vierten Viertel kurz den Platz. Er kam einige Augenblicke zurück, nachdem er an der Seitenlinie behandelt worden war. In 42 Minuten kam Davis auf 20 Punkte, zwölf Rebounds, vier Assists, drei Blocks und einen Steal. Tyreke Evans erzielte zehn seiner zwölf Punkte im ersten Viertel. In 37 Minuten schaffte er insgesamt noch zehn Rebounds, sechs Assists und einen Steal. Quincy Pondexter steuerte 18 Punkte und fünf Drei-Punkte-Würfe bei. Die Bucks haben ihr drittes Spiel hintereinander und acht ihrer letzten zehn verloren. Sie haben immer noch einen Vorsprung von dreieinhalb Spielen vor den Indiana Pacers und den Miami Heat für den sechsten Playoff-Platz. Michael Carter-Williams verwandelte bei seiner Rückkehr ins Team zwei von zwölf Würfen, nachdem er ein Spiel wegen einer Knöchelverletzung verpasst hatte.

Gerald Green scored 24 points in just 22 minutes for the first time since November 26th. After three straight double - figure scoring games, rookie T.J.

Trey Burke was dealing with back issues and didn’t play. Dante Exum was joined in the starting lineup by fellow rookie Rodney Hood, who was cleared of concussion symptoms after missing the previous game. Hood replaced Joe Ingles in the starting lineup and scored 17 points. He entered the game shooting 47 percent from the field since the All-Star break. Gordon Hayward scored 21 points on 18 shots and Rudy Gobert, potential Defensive Player of the Year, provided eight points, 15 rebounds, two assists, one steal and one block in 38 minutes.

It was a big night for two Blazers in particular, as center Jusuf Nurkic and guard C.J. McCollum combined for 72 points for Portland (36 - 38). Nurkic contributed a career - high scoring output of 33 points to go along with a whopping 16 rebounds and three blocks. The output came against his former team, from whom he was traded at the deadline. Nurkic was absolutely deadly from the field, shooting 12 - of - 15 from the field and 9 - of - 11 at the free - throw line. McCollum, meanwhile, shot 15 - of - 24 for a game - high 39 points. The two were the centers of a red - hot Blazers offense, as the team shot over 49 percent from the field and reached the line 33 times on the night. Denver (35 - 39), meanwhile, saw slightly more balanced production from their scorers. Six Nuggets scored in double figures, and their own young big man nearly recorded a triple - double. Sophomore center Nikola Jokic cleaned up, recording 17 points, eight rebounds, and eight assists. However, the team simply could not slow down the two hot scorers for Portland. Foul trouble proved problematic as well, as the Nuggets got to the line 20 times but gave up 33 free - throws to Portland. The game was hugely impactful on the playoff standings, as Portland was able to pass Denver for eighth in the conference thanks to the win.

The Clippers took a commanding 19 - point lead late in the third quarter and appeared to be on their way to clinching the first Western Conference Finals berth in franchise history. The Rockets, using a lineup without James Harden, embarked on a massive comeback in the fourth quarter. Corey Brewer and Josh Smith provided the offense down the stretch for Houston and, more importantly, the Rockets clamped down on defense. The Clippers' offense stagnated and could n't create the shots they were finding with ease through the first 36 minutes. Josh Smith, who was 2 - of - 12 from three point range in the series coming into Game 6, canned 4 out of 7 threes Thursday and finished with 19 points. The series will move back to Houston for the decisive Game 7 on Sunday. Time appeared to be winding down on Houston's season in the third quarter with Los Angeles' Blake Griffin making 360 degree layups and Chris Paul imposing his will. The Rockets never wavered, however, and fought their way back to send the series back to their home floor for Game 7. James Harden, the NBA's runner - up for MVP, did n't play in the fourth quarter. In addition to Smith and Brewer's strong play, Dwight Howard worked his way to a 20 - point, 21 - rebound performance over 40 minutes on the floor. It was one of the most stunning comebacks in franchise history, but it will be for not if the Rockets are unable to come away with a win Sunday. Los Angeles let a chance to advance to the Western Conference Finals slip away in front of a stunned home crowd. After routing the Rockets in the other two games at Staples Center this series, the Clippers seemingly lost their way late on Thursday. Despite holding Houston to 17 points in the third quarter, Los Angeles collapsed on the defensive end and allowed 40 points in the fourth. The Clippers missed their last 14 field goals before Paul's three pointer at the buzzer when the outcome had already been decided.

Oklahoma City has won six straight games, making a defining run following the return of their stars Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook to the lineup two weeks ago. Their win over the Suns was a drubbing that allowed the Thunder to play their starters limited minutes. Oklahoma City shot 48 percent from the field, but where they truly dominated the game was on the glass, collecting 63 rebounds compared to the Suns\\' 40 rebounds. The Suns also could n\\'t keep the Thunder off the free - throw line, allowing them to put up 30 free points at the charity stripe. Oklahoma City will start a three - game road trip in Sacramento on Tuesday against the Kings. Phoenix has dropped five straight games and appear to be in a tailspin, but that could correct itself as they embark on an Eastern Conference road trip this week that could allow them to get back in the win column. While the Suns had Isaiah Thomas return to action Friday in their 105 - 103 loss to the Detroit Pistons, the team also played without Goran Dragic on Sunday, as he was forced to sit out with a lower - back strain. Gerald Green earned the spot start in Dragic\\'s absence and finished with 15 points and seven rebounds in 26 minutes. Phoenix will host the Milwaukee Bucks on Monday.

The game provided plenty of fireworks with several outstanding individual stat lines, but the best individual matchup of the night was between the big men. Dwight Howard and Al Horford seemed to bring out each other\\'s best and virtually matched one another point for point and rebound and rebound. Howard finished with a season - high 30 points and added 16 rebounds, while Horford equaled him with a season - high 30 points and 14 rebounds. Due to the game remaining close throughout, both players also received a higher allotment of minutes than usual. The standoff between them also extended to the final statistics down low for both clubs, as they battled to a draw near the basket; Atlanta slightly outscored Houston in the paint, 50 - 46, while the Rockets nipped them in the rebounding department, 46 - 45. Besides Horford\\'s outstanding effort, the Hawks also got a trio of 20 - point - plus efforts from some of their most dependable starters. Kent Bazemore, already a solid contributor in rebounds and assists, turned his scoring up several notches, collecting 26 points on the night along with four assists and three rebounds. Stalwarts Jeff Teague and Paul Millsap contributed a pair of 22 - point tallies, with the latter making it a double - double by hauling in 13 boards as well.

Clint Capela was the third Rockets starter to accomplish the feat, posting 17 points and 10 rebounds. Trevor Ariza (10 points) and Patrick Beverley (nine points) rounded out the starting five\\'s contributions with modest outputs, while Ty Lawson continued his recent stretch of improved play by pacing the Houston bench with 14 points, four assists, a rebound and a steal.

Despite playing a somewhat limited role off the bench, Schroder has averaged 16 points and 9 assists in just 29 minutes per game over his last three outings. The Hawks do n\\'t have an MVP candidate on their roster, but if they keep beating the other top teams in the NBA, it makes the idea of extending the Player of the Month Award that was given to the entire starting five for their perfect 170 run in January an intriguing notion to suggest for the MVP award that is historically only given to one player. They have an 11 - game lead on the second - place Chicago Bulls, and they\\'re the only team in the NBA to already have a playoff spot secured. The Cavaliers are no slouches, but they\\'ve struggled a little lately, winning just two of their last five games. They had trouble protecting the ball Friday, as Kyrie Irving coughed up the ball five times, and LeBron James tied his career high for turnovers in regulation by losing the ball nine times. The Hawks forced a lot of those turnovers with great pressure defense to force the ball out of the Cavs\\' playmakers\\' hands, and they scored 20 easy points off the Cavs\\' 18 turnovers.

The Thunder never got within eight points the rest of the way, and a Horford three - pointer with two minutes to play put the exclamation point on a signature win for the East-leading Hawks. Atlanta, which shot 48 percent from the field, was led by 22 points and 10 rebounds from Paul Millsap. Horford finished with 14 points and 12 boards, while Jeff Teague added 17 points and nine assists. DeMarre Carroll chipped in 13 points, and Schroder had 13 of his own off the bench. The Hawks registered 27 assists as a team and out - rebounded the Thunder, who lead the NBA in rebounds per game, by an 11 - board margin. Oklahoma City got 22 points from Russell Westbrook and 21 from Kevin Durant, but only one other player, Serge Ibaka, scored in double - figures (13). The Thunder committed just 11 turnovers and connected on 10 three - pointers, but it was their interior defense that ultimately led to the loss. The Hawks scored more than half of their points in the paint (54) and shot 52 percent from two - point range. Up next, the Thunder head to Cleveland to take on the Cavaliers on Sunday afternoon.

The win over the Wolves, however, marks the Bucks\\' second straight win after they defeated division rival Inidana on Thursday. Six players scored in double digits for Milwaukee, with center Greg Monroe leading the way with 19. 21 - year - old small forward Giannis \"The Greek Freak\" Antetenkoumpo delivered a strong defensive showing to go along with 11 points and nine rebounds. The team shot just 42 percent from the field, but performed well from deep on the whole, knocking down 8 - of - 16 from beyond the arc. For the Wolves, meanwhile, rookie sensation Karl-Anthony Towns delivered a rare weak showing. The 20 - year - old center shot just 4 - for - 17, despite delivering a strong performance on the glass (10 rebounds) and on the defensive end (one steal, three blocks). Reigning Rookie of the Year Andrew Wiggins scored a team - high 19 points for Minnesota while also playing pesky defense, recording three steals. The Bucks are on a two - game win streak, but will face a challenging matchup against the powerhouse Spurs on Monday.

Pau Gasol injured his hamstring and was n't able to return after playing just 22 minutes. That made the impact of Nikola's Mirotic even more imperative, as the rookie showed he can be a big - game player. Mirotic had 12 points, eight rebounds and two steals in 22 minutes of action, as well as a plus - 19 in the plus/minus statistic, which was the highest of any player on either team. Regardless of his play, the Bulls would love to see Gasol back and healthy for Game 4 in Chicago on Sunday. The Cavaliers thought they were going to overtime, after J.R. Smith nailed a three - pointer with under eleven seconds to play. All they needed was one more stop, but Derrick Rose banked in his miraculous shot to end the Cavs hopes of an extra period. Kyrie Irving seemed to injure his foot in the first quarter and did n't quite look the same the rest of the way. He finished with just 11 points, four rebounds and two steals. Irving also failed to record an assists in 38 minutes. With Irving somewhat hobbled, it was up to LeBron James to take over for Cleveland.

The Hawks came out firing in this game and built an early lead, out - scoring the Bucks 48 - 35 in the first half alone. The Bucks made a run in the third to bring themselves within two, but the Hawks took off in the fourth quarter and finished with an 11 - point victory on the road. With the win, the Hawks ended the Bucks\\' four game winstreak, while also getting back in the winning column after losing their last two in a row. It was a relatively sloppy game, with each team committing at least 20 turnovers, but the Hawks were able to overcome and keep themselves positioned atop the Eastern Conference standings. The Hawks had six players reach double figures, including all five starters. Paul Millsap was especially effective, as he went off for 23 points (10 - 21FG, 1 - 3 3Pt, 2 - 2 FT), 16 rebounds and two blocked shots. The Bucks\\' frontcourt just did n\\'t have an answer for him defensively, as Millsap got all the shots he wanted, all game long. Center Al Horford also had an impressive showing, posting 15 points (5 - 12 FG, 0 - 1 3Pt, 5 - 6 FT), eight rebounds and two blocked shots. He struggled offensively in his first game back from the All-Star break with only seven points on Friday, so it looked as if Horford was back to his normal ways in Sunday\\'s matchup. The Hawks\\' backcourt duo of Kyle Korver (4 - 11 FG, 4 - 9 3Pt) and Jeff Teague (4 - 8 FG, 2 - 2 FT) also reached double figures with 12 and 10 points respectively. Teague has scored 12 points or less in each of his last four games, despite averaging 17 points on the season, so he\\'s still trying to get things turned back around. Dennis Schroder added 12 points (3 - 10 FG, 1 - 4 3Pt, 1 - 2 FT) and nine assists off the bench in 26 minutes. Giannis Antetokounmpo had a strong showing in this one, going 7 - for - 15 from the field to score 19 points, while also adding four rebounds and two blocked shots. After shooting just 23 percent (3 - 13 FG) from the field on Friday, it was good to see him get back on track, although he did n\\'t grab as many rebounds as he normally does. Khris Middleton added 19 points (6 - 12 FG, 1 - 4 3Pt, 6 - 6 FT) of his own, to go along with four rebounds and five assists. He\\'s had a nice stretch of four games, averaging 17 points, 6 rebounds and 3 assists over that span, so he showed no signs of slowing down Sunday. Receiving another start at point guard, Jarryd Bayless went 6 - for - 11 from the field and 1 - for - 2 from the three - point line to finish with 13 points, while adding three assists and three steals. It was his second straight start with Michael Carter-Williams still injured, as he\\'s combined for 24 points, 10 rebounds and 11 assists over that span, while posing as the replacement point guard in the starting lineup. As soon as Carter-Williams is healthy, it should push Bayless back to the bench. The Hawks\\' next game will be at home against the Dallas Mavericks on Wednesday, while the Bucks will travel to Chicago to play the Bulls on Monday.

Turnovers were the glaring difference in the game, as the Pistons committed just seven turnovers, while forcing 24 from the Trail Blazers. Portland dominated the shooting strangely enough, as they shot 52 percent to Detroit's 43 percent.

Damian Lillard did all he could for Portland, as he led the team with 34 points, 11 rebounds and nine assists. C.J. McCollum tallied 25 points, four rebounds and two assists. Jusuf Nurkic continued his good form with Portland, as he accrued 19 points, seven rebounds and five assists.

After holding just a two point lead after the first half, the Bucks used a monster second half to turn this game into a route, outscoring the Nets by 12 in the third period and nine in the fourth. The victory not only brought Milwaukee back to .500, but it also clinched them a playoff birth after holding the worst record in the NBA last season. Ersan Ilyasova led the way for the Bucks, scoring 21 points (8 - 12 FG, 3 - 6 3Pt), 11 of which came in the third quarter, and grabbing five rebounds in 28 minutes. This comes after Ilyasova scored just eight points in his previous two outings combined. Khris Middleton scored 16 points on 7 - of - 11 shooting to along with seven assists and four rebounds in 30 minutes of action. Giannis Antetokounmpo was not far behind, recording 13 points on 6 - of - 14 shooting, nine rebounds and seven assists in 30 minutes. O.J. Mayo scored 17 points (6 - 13 FG, 3 - 5 3Pt) in 20 minutes off the bench, while Michael Carter-Williams scored 12 to round out the five Milwaukee players who scored in double figures. The Bucks recorded 30 total assists on 41 made field goals, and the win leaves them as the No. 6 seed in the Eastern Conference, which is likely where they will stay as the season comes to an end. The loss is a big one for the Nets, as they are still fighting for their playoff lives, and this loss leaves them with just a half - game lead over the Pacers for the eighth and final playoff spot in the East with two games left on their schedule. Only one Brooklyn starter scored in double figures, as Brook Lopez recorded a double - double of 12 points (3 - 8 FG, 6 - 7 FT) and 10 rebounds in 31 minutes. Off the bench, both Mason Plumlee and Jarrett Jack scored 11 points in 17 and 24 minutes respectively. Deron Williams struggled mightily shooting the ball, going just 1 - for - 11 from the field en route to scoring just four points in 33 minutes. He was, however, able to record seven assists and seven rebounds. As a team, the Nets shot a dreadful 33 percent from the field and 17 percent from three, all while recording 21 turnovers to just 17 assists.

This game was nearly over before fans could settle into their seats as the Spurs jumped out to a 29 - 10 lead after one quarter. The rout was on from there as the Thunder failed to get into a rhythm on offense and simply could n\\'t get stops to cut into the lead. Oklahoma City\\'s Russell Westbrook was held in check, finishing with 17 points, two rebounds, and two assists in 26 minutes before being rested for the fourth quarter. San Antonio has now won eight games in a row and are putting pressure on the teams ahead of it in the Western Conference playoff standings.

Kawhi Leonard led the charge for the Spurs, scoring 26 points in 24 minutes on the floor. The lone blemish for the Spurs in Tuesday\\'s game was Tony Parker, who missed of the second half with tightness in his Achilles. The Spurs could have just been exercising caution with their veteran guard as they held a 26 - point lead at halftime and have another Game Wednesday against Houston. Oklahoma City once seemed to be a near lock for the eighth seed in the West, but a four - game slide has sent the Thunder tumbling out of the playoff standings. The Pelicans got the win Tuesday and are now in the driver\\'s seat for the last playoff spot. Oklahoma City is at a disadvantage down the stretch because New Orleans holds the head - to - head tiebreaker over the Thunder.

While they are sure to manage his minutes carefully in the first few games, an already formidable Cavs squad now stands to greatly benefit from the talent infusion that the All-Star point guard provides. The Sixers were led by Nerlens Noel\\'s 15 points, which he impressively supplemented with 12 rebounds, an assist, a steal and a block. The power forward was the sole Philadelphia starter with double - digit scoring, as reserves T.J. McConnell and Jakarr Sampson were the only other teammates to join him in that distinction with a pair of 10 - point efforts. Rookie standout Jahlil Okafor struggled against the one of the stingiest defenses in the NBA versus opposing centers, netting only nine points and eight rebounds. Robert Covington and Isaiah Canaan each struggled through a pair of 2 for 9 shooting performances from the field, and the Sixers shot a forgettable 35 percent as a team. Philadelphia fell to 1 - 28 and sports the worst record in the NBA.

Kevin Love joined Irving and James in double - digit scoring with 10 points, and the Cavs power forward added four rebounds, an assist and a steal over a scant 22 minutes. Timofey Mozgov\\'s eight - point, eight - rebound performance rounded out an efficient afternoon for the starters, and Matthew Delladedova was outstanding off the bench in relief of Irving with 20 points, two assists, two steals and two blocks.

It's been an up - and - down season for the Wizards, but they've now surprisingly handed two of the best teams in the Eastern Conference rare home losses. After having tripped up the Cavs at Quicken Loans Arena on Dec. 1, Washington pulled away from Miami in the final period Monday to hand the Heat only their fourth defeat at American Airlines Arena. Just as in their upset of Cleveland, the Wizards benefited from a stellar performance from their offensive linchpin John Wall, who managed 26 points, seven assists, a rebound and a steal, despite coming into the game nursing a sore knee. The visitors also got 21 points from Wall's backcourt mate Bradley Beal, who added four assists, three rebounds and a steal. Otto Porter pitched in with his third straight strong performance, tallying a 13 - point, 14 - rebound double - double. Jared Dudley contributed 12 points, four rebounds, an assist and a steal, an effort that included two three - pointers. Gary Neal (21 points) and Ramon Sessions (12 points) were highly efficient off the bench, with the former overcoming a groin injury to post his third consecutive double - digit scoring game. The Wizards improved to 9 - 10 but still reside in last place in the Eastern Conference's Southeast Division. They head home for a showdown with the Houston Rockets on Wednesday. The Heat was unable to keep pace with Washington despite superb efforts from their backcourt duo of Goran Dragic and Dwyane Wade. Dragic, who's struggled to score the majority of the season, managed a season - high 20 points. It marked the third consecutive game with double - digit points for the eight - year veteran, who appears to be finding his way in Miami's offensive system. Meanwhile, Wade came within an assist of his first double - double on the season, totaling 26 points, nine dimes, seven rebounds and a steal. Chris Bosh was ejected with 28 seconds left for arguing with the officials, but pitched in with his own near double - double, amassing 18 points, nine rebounds, four assists, a pair of blocks and a steal. Hassan Whiteside's 14 points, four rebounds and three blocks and Gerald Green's nine points rounded out solid performances from the starters, while Josh McRoberts paced the Miami bench with nine points, a pair of rebounds, an assist and a steal. Miami fell to 12 - 7 but retains control of first place in the Eastern Conference's Southeast Division by a half - game.

Anthony Davis took the reins for the Pelicans and came one block shy of posting the first triple - double of the season. In 36 minutes of game action, Davis finished with 26 points (10 - 22 FG), 17 rebounds, two assists, three steals, and nine blocks. To go along with Davis’ huge day, Ryan Anderson played extremely well off the bench scoring 22 points and adding nine rebounds. Omer Asik got his first double - double of the season, scoring 14 points and pulling in 17 rebounds. The Magic struggled due to injuries that kept a large portion of their lineup out of the game. Victor Oladipo is expected to miss most of the first month of the season recovering from surgery to fix a facial fracture, and Channing Frye was unavailable as he continues to work his way back from an MCL sprain in his knee. Frye was a game - time decision Tuesday, meaning he is likely to return to action soon. Lottery pick Elfrid Payton had a somewhat of a disappointing regular season debut, as he only scored four points. On a positive note, he did have seven assists and only two turnovers. Tobias Harris and Nikola Vucevic were the two bright spots for the Magic. Harris finished with 25 points and eight boards, while Vucevic ended with 15 points and 23 rebounds. The Magic’s other lottery pick, Aaron Gordon finished with 11 points (5 - 8 FG) in 28 minutes off the bench.

Toronto opened the game on an eye - popping 26 - 5 run during which linchpins Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan tallied 10 and nine points, respectively. The resilient Pacers then came back with a jaw - dropping 220 response, consisting of contributions from Jordan Hill, Rodney Stuckey, Paul George and Monta Ellis. From that point forward, Indiana outscored Toronto 79 - 64, while absolutely dominating down low. The Pacers managed 48 points in the paint for the game, as compared to only 20 by the Raptors. The vistors received a pair of 20 - point efforts from the backcourt duo of Lowry and DeRozan, although each played their best ball in the frenetic opening period. Terrence Ross was the only other starter with double - digit scoring (10), and Bismack Biyombo was only one point short of a double - double. He also pitched in 13 rebounds, his second game with as many boards in the last five contests. Patrick Patterson paced the Toronto bench with nine points, five rebounds and a steal. The Raptors fell to 16 - 10 but remain in first place in the Eastern Conference\\'s Atlantic Division. They head to Charlotte to face off against the Hornets on Thursday. For a change, the Pacers had a top scorer not named Paul George. While the All-Star small forward had a solid performance with 16 points, three rebounds, three assists and a steal, it was offseason acquisition and reserve Jordan Hill who spearheaded the offensive attack Monday. The veteran center equaled his season high with 20 points, while hauling in a season - best 13 boards over 31 minutes. A big man who\\'s always been known more for his offensive prowess, Hill has now managed five double - digit scoring efforts in seven December games. C. J. Miles (17 points) and Ellis (18 points) joined George as the other starters with double - digit points, while Stuckey checked in as the other notable scorer off the bench (10 points).

In a game that was tight throughout, the veteran Mavericks team prevailed in the final minutes. Dallas actually finished the game on a 20 - 6 run over the final eight minutes, as Los Angles seemingly could n\\'t make a shot. The Mavericks won nearly every statistic, as they led in shooting, assisting, steals, blocks and turnovers.

Barea flirted with a triple - double in this win, totaling 18 points, seven rebounds and eight assists. Barnes led the team in scoring, dropping 31 points on 11 - of - 18 shooting. Justin Anderson, Dwight Powell and Seth Curry were the only three players to come off the bench, as they each provided at least 10 points and four rebounds. Curry was especially good, amassing 23 points, four rebounds, four assists and three steals.

Julius Randle recorded a double - double, tallying 15 points and 10 rebounds. D\\'Angelo Russell too just nine shots in the defeat, but still finished with 12 points, five rebounds and seven assists.

The Knicks (17 - 19) were playing on the second game of a back - to - back Saturday, and accordingly, looked sluggish in trying to defend a relentless and balanced attack by the Pacers (19 - 18). Indiana opened the game with a strong 33 - point first quarter, and then proceeded to outscore their visitors by a dominating 29 - 14 margin in the second. That gave them the cushion they'd need to tally their 14th home victory in 19 games this season. The Pacers saw four of their five starters notch double digits in the scoring column and posted 50 and 46 percent success rates from the field and three - point range, respectively. New York was led by a pair of 17 - point efforts from Carmelo Anthony and Justin Holiday. Anthony added five assists and two rebounds, while Holiday dished out four assists and brought down three boards.

It all started with a 26 - 15 first quarter and the Warriors did'nt look back after that. The Golden State defense absolutely stifled Memphis in this game, as the Grizzlies shot just 34 percent, while shooting just 3 - of - 15 from three - point range. The Warriors have one of the best defenses in the NBA and the Grizzlies have one of the worst offenses, so this was simply a mismatch of epic proportions. The Warriors were once again led by MVP Steph Curry, as he recorded 28 points, five rebounds, five assists and five steals in the victory. Golden State also got another nice performance from Harrison Barnes, who tallied 19 points, four rebounds, three assists and three steals. This is such a scary team right now, considering Klay Thompson has been struggling and the Warriors have been playing without their head coach Steve Kerr. The sky is the limit for this young team and after winning the title last season, it's a nightmare for the rest of the league that they are possibly better this year. They'll look to stay undefeated against the Minnesota Timberwolves on Thursday in the second half of a back - to - back.

If they ca n't hold teams under 100 points with the offense they have, they simply ca n't win enough games to compete in the Western Conference. One bright spot in the loss has to be center Marc Gasol, who scored a season - high 26 points while grabbing seven boards in the defeat.

Lillards finished with 32 points, to go with five rebounds and two assists and added three buckets from behind the arc to stave off Los Angeles down the stretch. As for the Clippers, Paul finished with 26 points, three rebounds and nine assists on 10 - of - 21 shooting.

The Grizzlies seem to have discovered a successful formula with their current frontcourt rotation. Coach Dave Joerger moved veteran Zach Randolph to the bench nine games ago, promoting Matt Barnes and Jeff Green to the starting lineup in the process. Since the personnel shift, Randolph has tallied six double - digit scoring performances, while receiving a few extra minutes of valuable rest each night. Meanwhile, both Barnes and Green have put together some productive outings with the additional playing time. Sunday provided a tangible example of the positive results the rotation has brought, with Randolph producing 16 points, three rebounds and a steal over just 20 minutes. Green amassed 17 points and four rebounds himself, while Barnes only managed a modest five points, but hauled in eight boards. The Grizzlies also outscored the Lakers in the paint by the comfortable margin of 44 - 28, and outrebounded them on the defensive glass, 34 - 28. The visitors also received solid efforts from three other members of their starting five, Marc Gasol, Mike Conley and Courtney Lee. Gasol pitched in 16 points and added six rebounds and a steal, while the pair of guards combined for 32 points, six rebounds, eight assists and five swipes. Randolph\\'s aforementioned 16 points paced the Memphis bench, and Mario Chalmers joined him as the other double - digit scoring reserve with 11 points. The backup point guard supplemented his scoring with seven assists and a steal over the season - high 29 minutes he received. The Grizzlies improved their record to 17 - 16 and currently reside in third place in the Western Conference\\'s Southwest Division. They head home to face the Miami Heat on Tuesday. The Lakers could not follow up their scrappy Christmas Day effort versus the Clippers with a similar performance.

Kobe Bryant did continue his stretch of considerably improved play by leading the Lakers with a 19 - point tally on 6 of 15 shooting. He added three assists and a pair of rebounds, and now has 10 straight double - digit scoring games. Rookie Larry Nance, Jr. turned in a notable performance of his own, contributing a career - high 17 points and hauling in 11 boards for his first career double - double. Jordan Clarkson was the only other starter with double - digit points, pouring in 12 and adding three assists and a pair of rebounds. 2015 first - round pick D\\'Angelo Russell paced the Lakers\\' reserves with 10 points, three assists and a steal, his third consecutive double - digit scoring effort.

The Cavaliers got out to an extremely quick start, out - scoring the Celtics 29 - 16 in the first quarter, while grabbing a 61 - 36 lead by half. They did n\\'t slow down coming out of the half either, out - scoring the Celtics 34 - 17 in the third quarter, therefore setting them up to pull off an impressive 31 - point win in front of their home crowd. The Cavaliers were the superior shooting team in this game, going 48 percent from the field and 36 percent from the three - point line, while the Celtics finished at 35 percent from the floor and just 25 percent from deep. It also did n\\'t help that the Celtics turned the ball over 16 times, while forcing the Cavs into just 11. LeBron James had himself a day Wednesday, going 12 - for - 23 from the field and 3 - for - 3 from the free throw line to finish with 27 points, while adding five assists and three steals in just 26 minutes. He\\'s been absolutely on fire of late, averaging 35 points, 7 rebounds and three steals per game over his last three outings. Returning to the starting lineup after missing two games with a strained left shoulder, Kyrie Irving showed no signs of still being affected by the injury. In 26 minutes, he posted 18 points (6 - 10 FG, 2 - 4 3Pt, 4 - 4 FT), five assists and two steals. He could\\'ve recorded even higher numbers, but considering the blow out and the recent injury, he was limited to just under 25 minutes on the court. Coming just shy of a double - double, Kevin Love finished with 12 points (4 - 10 FG, 2 - 6 3Pt, 2 - 2 FT) and eight rebounds in 24 minutes. Like both Irving and James, he could\\'ve had a lot more production, but the Cavaliers were up by so much, that the coaching staff felt it was necessary to rest the starters. He\\'s now averaging 17 points and 10 rebounds on the season. Tristan Thompson added 10 points on 4 - of - 4 shooting from the field, to go along with seven rebounds as well. As shown by their final score, the Celtics really struggled to find a source of scoring. Brandon Bass was one of the only consistent options in this game, as he went 7 - for - 15 from the field and 1 - for - 1 from the three - point line to score a team - high of 15 points, while adding five rebounds as well. He\\'s had a nice start to March offensively, recording two games in a row with 15 points.The only other Celtic to reach double figures was Isaiah Thomas, who came off the bench for 11 points (4 - 13 FG, 0 - 3 3Pt 3 - 4 FT) and two assists in just 20 minutes. Since joining the Celtics just six games ago, he\\'s been arguably their best source of scoring, averaging 20 points over that six game span. Also off the bench, rookie James Young posted nine points (2 - 5 FG, 2 - 5 3Pt, 3 - 3FT) in just 17 minutes. Other than Bass, the Celtics starters combined for just 19 points, which wo n\\'t win any team very many ball games.

The Pacers led for over 30 straight minutes, from 23 - 20 with 1:44 left in the first quarter all the way until the Hawks took a 90 - 88 lead off an Al Horford dunk with 5:55 to remain in the game. But the Pacers were n\\'t fazed, as they would allow just one more basket for the rest of the game as they stepped on the gas and pulled away for good with a 23 - 2 run to close the game. Monta Ellis was on fire from three - point land, as he knocked down five of his seven shots from deep and finished with 25 points, six assists and five steals to lead the Pacers. George Hill knocked down three three - pointers tto fuel an 18 - point, eight - rebound night, and Myles Turner notched an efficient 20 points in 26 minutes to help hide a rare off night from Paul George (2 - 11 FG, 11 points). Jeff Teague led the Hawks with 20 points and dished a team - high five assists, but he was one of the rare bright spots for a stagnant Hawks offense that managed just 40 percent from the field. Al Horford scored 14 on 6 - 12 shooting and Thabo Sefolosha had a sharp 13 points on 4 - 7 shooting off the bench, but the Hawks just could not connect from deep. Kyle Korver managed just 1 - 7 from three - point land, and the team finished a brutal 7 - 28 (25 percent). Atlanta next faces the Heat this Sunday in Miami.

Atlanta won this one with defense, as they blocked 12 shots and held the Raptors to just 38 percent shooting from the field. Toronto\\'s biggest lead came at 11 - 7 with 8:26 to go in the first quarter. The Hawks immediately rattled off a 60 run to take the lead, and the Raptors never led again, as Toronto\\'s offense could n\\'t generate the big run necessary to turn things around.

Paul Millsap turned in a double - double with 13 points and 14 rebounds to go with five blocked shots, and Kyle Korver knocked down four of eight three - point attempts as he finished with 14 points. Atlanta shot a mediocre 43 percent from the floor but shot a nifty 12 - 32 (38 percent) from three - point land to keep their offense moving.

Jonas Valanciunas scored 13 points and added eight rebounds, and Bismack Biyombo came off the bench to score 10 points and grab nine rebounds in just 21 minutes. But the Raptors just could n\\'t generate offense, and they managed just eight offensive rebounds on 52 missed shots, a meager 15 percent offensive rebound rate, leaving them without the critical second chance opportunities teams need when first shots are n\\'t falling.

       "  'input': 'Input text: The New Orleans Pelicans (42 - 35) defeated the Golden State Warriors (63 - 15) 103 - 100 on Tuesday at the Smoothie King Center in New Orleans. The end of this game came down to free throws for the Pelicans, as Tyreke Evans made 1 - of - 2 attempts with 17 seconds left to put them up one, while Anthony Davis hit 2 - of - 2 with just under 10 seconds left in the game to put them up three. Stephen Curry had a shot to tie it at the buzzer, but he missed and gave the Pelicans a huge win. With the victory, the Pelicans overtook the Oklahoma City Thunder for the eighth and final projected playoff seed in the West. The Thunder took a tough loss to the Spurs on Tuesday as well, so the Pelicans now hold a half game lead over the Thunder with just five games left on their schedule. It was the frontcourt duo of Anthony Davis and Quincy Pondexter that pushed the Pelicans to the key victory. Davis finished with 29 points (10 - 21 FG, 0 - 2 3Pt, 9 - 12 FT), 10 rebounds and four blocked shots, while Pondexter had 20 points, shooting 6 - for - 7 from the field and 4 - for - 4 from the three - point line. Davis has really stepped up ever since the middle of March in order to get this team in position for a playoff berth in the loaded Western Conference. Over his last 10 games, he\\'s averaging 25 points, 9 rebounds and 3 blocks, so it\\'s not surprising how well he played again in this one. This marked just the second time all season that Pondexter reached the 20 - point mark, so it came at the right time for the Pelicans during their intense battle with the Thunder for that final playoff spot. Tyreke Evans did a little bit of everything as well. He finished with 12 points (4 - 8 FG, 4 - 5 FT), six rebounds, nine assists and four steals, so despite scoring less than his season average, it was still a very productive showing for the guard. Draymond Green and Stephen Curry did their best to keep the Warriors in position to grab the win. Curry finished with 25 points (9 - 18 FG, 5 - 8 3Pt, 2 - 2 FT), six rebounds and nine assists, while Green added 24 points (10 - 18 FG, 3 - 7 3Pt, 1 - 2 FT) and 14 rebounds. Curry missed a few big shots late in the game, but he still surpassed the 20 - point mark for the ninth time over his last 10 outings. Green was really struggling of late, combining to go just 4 - for - 18 from the field and 1 - for - 6 from the three - point line in his two previous games, so it was a step in the right direction for him, pushing his season averages to 12 points and eight rebounds on the season. The surprise of the night was Klay Thompson, who just could n\\'t get his shot to fall. He went just 2 - for - 10 from the field and 1 - for - 5 from deep to score seven points, marking his second poor performance in a row. He shot just 3 - of - 11 from the field in Sunday\\'s game against the Spurs, so he needs to get locked back in before the playoffs start next week. The Pelicans\\' next game will be on the road against the Memphis Grizzlies on Wednesday, while the Warriors will be at home against the Portland Trail Blazers on Thursday.

New York led by 13 points entering the fourth quarter but allowed the Pelicans, playing without Anthony Davis and Jrue Holiday, to slowly creep back into the game. With just over six minutes to play, Quincy Pondexter connected on a three - pointer to bring New Orleans within six, and a Tyreke Evans layup a few minutes later trimmed the deficit to just three with 3:13 to play. Following a Carmelo Anthony layup, Evans knocked down two free throws and hit a jumper to bring the Pelicans within one with 1:55 to play. After Anthony was called for a charge, the Pelicans could not convert two opportunities on the other end, and New York retained possession up one point with 42 seconds remaining. On the ensuing possession, Anthony kicked the ball out to Jose Calderon, who drilled a three - pointer with 32 seconds left. After Anderson misfired on a three, the Knicks secured the rebound and Anthony hit three straight free throws to ice the game.

Amar’e Stoudemire added 14 points in 21 minutes off the bench. The Pelicans got 23 points from Evans and 20 from Eric Gordon but were simply unable to compensate for the losses of Holiday and, especially, Davis.

Despite securing the six - point victory, the Grizzlies did n't have as much success shooting the ball as the Hawks did. The Hawks went 41 percent from the field and 40 percent from the three - point line, while the Grizzlies finished at 39 percent from the floor and a meager 23 percent from beyond the arc. While they may not have had the shooting advantage, the Grizzlies did it elsewhere, as they out - rebounded the Hawks 55 - 37 and forced them into 14 turnovers, while committing only 11 of their own. Offensively, the Grizzlies leaned on the duo of Mike Conley and Marc Gasol. Conley went 7 - for - 12 from the field and 2 - for - 4 from the three - point line to finish with a team - high of 21 points, while also adding six assists. He's been shooting the ball really well lately, shooting higher than 50 percent from the field in three out of his last four games. Gasol, on the other hand, recorded 16 points (6 - 14 FG, 0 - 1 3Pt, 4 - 4 FT), 10 rebounds and two blocked shots. His rebounding numbers were down a bit, as he's recorded less than seven rebounds in each of his last three games, so it was good to see him notch the double - double and get back to producing some higher numbers. Zach Randolph did n't have his best night shooting the ball, but still finished with 11 points (5 - 16 FG, 1 - 2 FT), to go along with 15 rebounds and two steals. He's now had at least 10 rebounds in 21 of his last 22 games. Jeff Green added 11 points (3 - 10 FG, 1 - 3 3Pt, 4 - 4 FT) and six rebounds. For the Hawks, Jeff Teague did most of the damage offensively. He went 9 - for - 13 from the field and 1 - for - 2 from the three - point line to finish with 22 points, while also handing out six assists. He's been on a hot stretch of late, averaging 24 points and seven assists over his last three games. DeMare Carroll was the only other starter in double figures for points, recording 10 points (3 - 9 FG, 2 - 6 3Pt, 2 - 2 FT) and five rebounds in 29 minutes. The other three starters combined to go 7 - for - 27 from the field to score just 18 points, which may have played a big factor in the loss. Coming off the bench, Kent Bazemore had the most success, posting 14 points (5 - 11 FG, 2 - 4 3Pt, 2 - 2 FT), five rebounds and two steals in 29 minutes. Considering he's averaging only four points per game on the season, it was a nice surprise for the Hawks. Both Mike Scott and Dennis Schroder added 11 points each.

The former Michigan standout finished with a game - high 29 points on 9 - of - 16 shooting from the field. Dwight Howard was effective down low as well, posting yet another double - double of 14 points and a game - high 16 rebounds, but overall for Atlanta, it was a forgettable offensive night.

Mike Conley was lethal from behind the arc en route to one of his finest performances of the season, as his 38 points were more than enough to lead the Grizzlies (29 - 21) to a rout of the Suns (15 - 33) on the road. Memphis went into the half with an 11 - point lead, and built that into a 20 - point blowout by midway through the third quarter, where Conley sank all three free throws that came on a foul behind the three point line. First-round pick Marquese Chriss had a solid outing for the Suns in the loss, going 8 - of - 12 from the field on his way to 20 points and six boards. Conley\\'s big night was aided by nine assists and six rebounds, in addition to the 7 - of - 10 three point shooting and 12 - of - 18 total from the field. Marc Gasol was efficient in his 18 points, which came on 12 shots, however, the big man has cooled off considerably following a stretch of 30 - plus point performances. Zach Randolph led the bench with 18 points, while the Grizzlies shot a remarkable 57 percent from three - point land. Phoenix got two 20 - plus point performances from Devin Booker and Chriss, but the scoring was far from efficient, which has been a trend for most opponents of Memphis this season, given their strength on the defensive end of the floor. Memphis stole the ball 13 times from the Suns, and had no problem putting the Suns on the charity stripe given their comfortable lead early in the second half.

The recent play of Kent Bazemore, who has replaced Thabo Sefolosha as the team’s starting shooting guard, has been a key reason behind the Hawks’ success against the Hornets. In those two games, Bazemore has recorded 39 points, including 20 on Sunday. He also made his presence felt on the defensive end, recording three steals and a blocked shot. Though their attempt to claim their first win fell just short, the Hornets were able to set a club record for three - point attempts with 37 in the contest. However, they’re still struggling to find efficiency, as the team shot just 37 percent from the field Sunday.

A new week started with more of the same, as Milwaukee exploited a depleted Heat squad by scoring an impressive road triumph at the American Airlines Arena, where Miami had tallied a 15 - 8 record coming into tonight's contest. The same formula that's largely spearheaded the Bucks' recent successes - - leaning on the talented triumverate of Khris Middleton, Giannis Antetokounmpo and Greg Monroe - - worked well again Tuesday, and proved pivotal in helping the visitors keep their momentum going.

Greg Monroe extended a notable streak himself, posting a sixth straight double - double with 15 points, 10 rebounds, an assist and a block.

The Sacramento Kings absolutely manhandled the Los Angeles Lakers in this game, as they were up 74 - 50 at halftime. The Kings were led by a 21 point - 11 rebound double - double from DeMarcus Cousins and a 21 point - eight assist outing from newcomer Rajon Rondo. They both got in those impressive lines in under 30 minutes and if the game weren’t so out of hand, they would have posted some huge numbers. The biggest discrepancy in the game was the rebounding differential, as the Kings outrebounded the Lakers 56 - 37. Only one Lakers starter played more than 22 minutes in this game and that can be attributed to the crooked scoreline. The Lakers were led by Jordan Clarkson, who scored 22 points in his 28 minutes of play. After having a heartbreaking loss in the opener where the Lakers blew a double - digit lead in the fourth quarter, this was a major letdown for a young team that is struggling defensively. The Lakers have now allowed at least 28 points in six of eight quarters this season and the defense could be a major issue all year. The one silver lining is that the Lakers starters will be well rested for their next game on Sunday against the Dallas Mavericks at home. The Kings got some great starts from former All-Stars DeMarcus Cousins, Rajon Rondo and Rudy Gay in this game and also got nice contributions from rookie Willie Cauley-Stein and veteran Omri Casspi. Coach George Karl decided to implement Cauley-Stein into the lineup for this game after not starting him in the opener and he performed admirably, tallying 17 points, nine rebounds, and three blocks across 30 minutes of play. This will be a fluent situation, but the rookie has definitely earned more playing time with a performance like this. It's a good thing the Kings starters got some rest here, as they play the second half of a back - to - back set against the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday in LA.

The importance of the rather unlikely road victory for Houston can not be underscored, as the Rockets had come in to the contest having dropped three of their previous four games and in tangible danger of losing their grip on the eighth seed in the conference. Further dampening their prospects was the Raptors' formidable defense, as well as the 12 - game home winning streak they carried into the Sunday night affair. Despite the rather long odds and a 61 - 51 halftime deficit, the visitors rallied on the strength of a typically remarkable effort from James Harden, who collected at least 40 points for the third time in the last six games. Corey Brewer also played a pivotal role off the bench with a 23 - point tally, and the oft - maligned Houston defense was able to elicit 15 turnovers from Toronto. The superior second - half performance was enough to earn the Rockets their first win north of the border since the 2006 - 2007 campaign. Harden added 14 assists, five rebounds and a steal to his game - high 40 - point total, and made a whopping 19 visits to the charity stripe. Brewer paced the Rockets reserves with his aforementioned 23 points, and supplemented it with four rebounds and a trio of assists. Dwight Howard was right behind with a 21 - point, 11 - rebound double - double that also included an assist, a steal and two blocks. Trevor Ariza followed with 13 points, two assists, a rebound and three steals. Although he could n't quite get into double digits in scoring, Patrick Beverley generally held his own against Kyle Lowry and filled out the stat sheet with seven points, eight rebounds, three assists and three steals. The Rockets are currently in fourth place in the Western Conference's Southwest Division, and they retain a rather tenuous hold on the eighth seed in the conference by one - and - one - half games over the Utah Jazz. They now head to Philadelphia to face off against the Sixers on Wednesday night. For a change, the Raptors were paced on offense by someone not named Lowry or DeMar DeRozan. Luis Scola surprisingly led the way for Toronto, as he capitalized on his matchup against the Rockets' woeful power forward defense to post 21 points, three rebounds and a steal. DeRozan did follow close behind with 19 points, seven assists, six rebounds and two steals. Lowry was next with 17 points, nine assists, four rebounds and three steals. Jonas Valanciunas put in a full day's work against Dwight Howard, posting a 12 - point, 10 - rebound double - double that also included a trio of blocks. Corey Joseph (nine points, five rebounds and three assists) and Terrence Ross (nine points, two rebounds, an assist and a steal) co - led the Toronto bench.

In particular, Gordon Hayward and George Hill, who typically form the crux of the Jazz offense, both struggled from the field. Hayward scored only nine points, while Hill went just 6 - of - 18 from the field. What was reassuring for Utah, however, was that forward Derrick Favors produced a strong performance.

Eric Bledsoe drained the free throws on the other end of the court to extend the lead to five points, which rendered Kent Bazemore's buzzer beating three pointer useless, as the Suns came away with the home win. Phoenix followed up a 36 point first quarter with a lowly 14 points in the second, which kept the Hawks within striking distance after they had multiple opportunities to put the game away early.

Golden State (35 - 6) avenged its loss on Christmas day with a crushing victory over the Cavaliers on Monday. The Warriors came out strong from the start, establishing a double - digit lead in the first quarter and a 20 - point lead by midway through the second. Everything seemed to be firing for Golden State on both sides of the ball, as the Warriors shot a ridiculous 50 percent from the floor while draining 15 three - pointers. Despite historic matchup troubles with Cleveland, reigning MVP Steph Curry delivered on Monday, scoring 20 points to go with 11 assists and four steals. Curry had recorded a double - double by the end of the Warriors\\' electrifying first half, playing a major part of the 29 - point lead the team was able to establish. Overall, Golden State absolutely demolished Cleveland in every aspect, including holding a 58 - 35 rebounding advantage. Cleveland (29 - 11) had won four straight against the Warriors prior to Monday\\'s game. The Cavaliers played arguably their worst game of the season, shooting just 35 percent from the field and recording only 11 assists. While pregame statements from team leader LeBron James indicated that Cleveland had undergone no special preparation for Monday\\'s game, the drubbing still came as a surprise to most. James led the team with 20 points but shot just 6 - of - 18 and committed an uncharacteristic six turnovers. Kyrie Irving was just 6 - of - 19, while Kevin Love was held to only three points.

Kyrie Irving didn’t play due to left knee tendinitis, an injury that stemmed from overcompensating for his right foot strain the previous round. The decision was made after he flew to Florida in the morning to meet with Dr. James Andrews. Irving has already been listed as questionable for Game 3. The Cavaliers pulled away from the Hawks with a 21 - 6 run to start the third quarter, leading to an 84 - 66 advantage heading into the final period. LeBron James narrowly missed a triple - double, closing the contest with 30 points, 11 assists, nine rebounds and one block in 39 minutes. He also hit a playoff - high two three - pointers, improving his overall shooting to 9 - of - 56 from downtown in this postseason. Tristan Thompson hauled 16 rebounds, five of which were offensive, two fewer than the Hawks. Matthew Dellavedova started in place of Irving and finished with 11 points, six rebounds, four assists and one steal in 37 minutes. Iman Shumpert knocked in four of the team’s 12 three - pointers and compiled 16 points in 34 minutes. The loss marks the first time all season the Hawks lost two straight home games. They converted an uncharacteristic 6 - of - 26 three - pointers, a cumulative 10 - of - 49 in two games against the Cavaliers. DeMarre Carroll remained in the starting lineup after suffering a left knee sprain in Game 1. His sticktoitiveness was offset by Kyle Korver’s sprained right ankle late in the third quarter, one that held out the three - point marksman the rest of the game. Al Horford suffered a knee injury to boot, yet gave coach Mike Budenholzer a few minutes even though the game had already been decided.

Despite opening the season on their home court, the Rockets struggled to find the bottom of the net in this one. As a team, the Rockets shot just 34 percent from the field and limped to a brutal 23 percent clip from deep. The Nuggets, on the other hand, stayed hot all game long, shooting 50 percent from the field and 48 percent from beyond the arc. In a relatively ugly game with 37 combined turnovers between the teams, the Nuggets were able to cash in the most and finished with a surprising 20 - point victory. Emmanuel Mudiay, the Nuggets' seventh overall pick in the 2015 NBA Draft, made his much anticipated regular season debut. Mudiay had a strong day shooting the ball, finishing with 17 points (6 - 13 FG, 3 - 5 3Pt, 2 - 4 FT) over 37 minutes. He nearly completed the unconventional triple - double, as he also posted nine assists and 11 turnovers. While the ridiculous amount of turnovers is concerning, the Nuggets will need to give their rookie some time to settle in and get accustomed to NBA basketball. Danilo Gallinari led the Nuggets in scoring, recording a team - high of 23 points (7 - 15 FG, 3 - 5 3Pt, 6 - 6 FT), to go along with eight rebounds and three blocked shots. He averaged just 12 points and 4 rebounds last season, so it was a very nice start for the sixth - year guard. Kenneth Faried was the third Nuggets' starter in double figures with 18 points (8 - 10 FG, 2 - 6 FT) and nine rebounds. With Dwight Howard sitting out on suspension after accumulating a flagrant foul during the 2014 - 15 postseason, it was James Harden and Terrence Jones who did everything they could to make up for his absence. Harden struggled from deep, hitting just two of his twelve attempts from the three - point line, but still finished with a team - high of 22 points. Harden came just short of being named the league MVP last season, so this was not the start he had in mind. Jones recorded 15 points (6 - 13 FG, 0 - 2 3Pt, 3 - 5 FT) of his own, while pulling down six rebounds. The only other Rocket to reach double figures was Ty Lawson, who scored 12 points (3 - 10 FG, 2 - 3 3Pt, 4 - 6 FT) in his Rockets debut. Lawson averaged 15 points and 10 assists with the Nuggets last season, so do n't be surprised to see his numbers rise over the next few games.

The Celtics (10) came into this game as a 12 - point favorite, but the Nets (0 - 1) made them work for a relieving win. A 36 - 25 fourth quarter is how Brooklyn crawled back in the game, but Boston did just enough to hold on. The offense was incredibly efficient for the Celtics, as they shot 54 percent from the field and recorded 36 assists on their 48 made baskets. The 22 combined blocks and steals for Boston doubled up that of Brooklyn, who recorded just 11 in total. Brooklyn was expected to be one of the worst teams in the NBA, but they gave an elite team a run for their money in the opener. The bench was key for the Nets, as Sean Kilpatrick, Joe Harris and Justin Hamilton combined for 48 points and 18 rebounds off the pine. Hamilton actually finished with 19 points and 10 rebounds in the best game of his career. Bojan Bogdanovic led the team in scoring, dropping 21 points on 9 - for - 17 shooting. Jeremy Lin played well in his debut as well, amassing 18 points, three rebounds and three assists. Boston made this one a nail biter, but they ended up getting their much deserved win. Isaiah Thomas scored a game - high 25 points in the victory, also adding six rebounds and nine assists. Jae Crowder was second on the team, with his 21 points and five boards. Avery Bradley fell a rebound shy of a double - double, totaling 17 points, nine rebounds and five assists. Al Hoford stuffed the stat sheet in his debut, accumulating 11 points, five rebounds, six assists and four blocks in the win.

The key for New Orleans was their defense, as they held Boston to 40 percent from the field and 29 percent from three - point range. Rim protection killed Boston as well, as they failed to record a block in their loss. The assist - to - turnover ratio kept the Celtics hanging around, as they committed 12 turnovers to 19 assists, while the Pelicans committed 17 turnovers to their 16 assists. The Celtics (5 - 5) continue to struggle without Al Horford (concussion) and Jae Crowder (ankle) and this was easily their worst loss of the season. Isaiah Thomas did his best to carry Boston to a win though, tallying 37 points, three rebounds and seven assists. Avery Bradley continued his surprising rebounding rate, as he totaled 19 points and 10 rebounds in the loss. Marcus Smart was the only other Boston player in double figures, amassing 15 points, six rebounds, three assists and four steals. Boston will look to rebound on Wednesday, when they host the Dallas Mavericks for their next game. The Pelicans (2 - 9) got a much needed win here, but it was far from easy.

The Bucks came into this game as the worst rebounding team in the NBA, but actually outrebounded Dallas 52 - 34 in the loss. They also outshot Dallas and that\\'s a rare sight to see a team win when getting outrebounded and outshot. The difference for the Mavericks were the turnovers, as they committed just four to the Bucks 17. Milwaukee has been terrible on the road all season and they didn’t play great here. No player scored more than 19 points and the team had a lack of offensive execution that was clearly evident. In fact, Milwaukee had just 14 assists and that\\'s not good enough in an NBA game. Jerryd Bayless made his return from injury and played brilliantly, contributing 19 points and seven assists off the bench. The road woes are a big worry for this team and it\\'ll likely get worse on Tuesday when they have to take on the Thunder in Oklahoma City. This was one of the first games all year that the team got a full complement of minutes from all of its players. Wesley Matthews and Chandler Parsons both suffered devastating injuries last season, but they both started here and played at least 30 minutes for the first time together. Matthews scored a team - high 22 points and continues to play great defense. The most underrated acquisition from the summer was Zaza Pachulia though, as he had another great game on Monday.

With this win the Celtics extend their home winning streak to an impressive 13 games and their home record to 22 - 10 overall. Boston has been averaging 112 points per game in its last 12 at home and although came up short of that in this one, mounted an impressive rally to overcome an eight - point deficit with four minutes left in the fourth quarter. The Celtics were still down by one when they called time - out with 21 seconds left. Avery Bradley then converted a tough, driving lay - up to go up by one with 17 seconds left and ultimately take the win against a stubborn Knicks squad. Isaiah Thomas was a beast for the Celtics as he led the way with a game - high 32 points (9 - 15 FG, 2 - 5 3Pt, 12 - 13 3Pt), along with eight assists, three rebounds and two steals, in 35 minutes.

This is certainly not the type of game that will make any highlight reel anytime soon. Both teams played some horrendous offense and they may have set basketball back a few years. Both of these teams have been struggling mightily coming into this game and it made this game hard to watch at times. Utah was especially bad, as they shot 35 percent from the field and committed 19 turnovers in the loss. The turnover differential was the key, as the Timberwolves commuted just 10, which is almost half as many as the Jazz. The Jazz had one of their worst offensive performances in franchise history and it\\'s clear the injuries are really starting to hurt this team. It\\'s one thing to play without Rudy Gobert, but this offense has no punch without Derrick Favors and Alec Burks. That can be exemplified by the fact that they started this game just 5 - for - 30 from the field and scored just 13 points in the first 14 minutes. It\\'s not like it got much better after that though, as they failed to crack 21 points outside of the fourth quarter. The lone bright spots were Trey Burke and Jeff Withey. Withey tallied 13 points and nine rebounds filling in for Favors and Burke scored 23 points off the bench. Utah will look to find some offense in their next game on Thursday against the Portland Trail Blazers. While the Jazz offense was a nightmare, the Timberwolves played some of their best defense of the season here. This marked the lowest point total the Wolves have allowed this season and it\\'s a good sign to see them play like this with their struggles at home all year. Ricky Rubio did a great job of setting up the offense, as he dished out 17 assists to go along with 10 points in the win. Rookie Karl Anthony-Towns recorded a double - double as well, tallying 25 points and 10 rebounds in the victory. This wasn’t a pretty game by any means, but a win is a win. Minnesota will look to keep up this defensive momentum on Thursday against the Detroit Pistons. Table format: There are two tables in the given text.   The first table has six columns and two rows.

No Stephen Curry, no problem. The Warriors rallied behind Klay Thompson and Draymond Green and made a strong statement with their MVP sidelined with a knee injury for now. The rout was on and it happened quickly, after Golden State stormed out to 37 - 20 lead at the end of the first quarter. Thompson was lights out from behind the arc, as he knocked down 7 - of - 11 shots from deep, while Green stuffed the box score. Shaun Livingston was effective in handling the ball and the minutes he received during all the fourth quarters that the Warriors starters were sitting seemed to be vital to close out the series. James Harden did not go out quietly, and through most of the game, the all - star shooting guard was responsible for half of his team\\'s points through three quarters, but he also committed far too many turnovers. The Warriors capitalized on 17 Rockets turnovers, which only aided to the home team\\'s lead from the get go. Harden finished with 35 points, six rebounds, six assists, two steals and seven turnovers on 12 - of - 23 shooting. Dwight Howard was a monster on the boards and bullied Andrew Bogut around in the paint, as he contributed eight points and 21 rebounds and five assists in the contest. Golden State moved the ball to the tune of 30 team assists, as both Livingston and Green commanded the floor with poise. Thompson found himself constantly open around the perimeter through a series of low screens set by Green and Bogut, and he turned those opportunities into 27 points on 10 - of - 14 shooting. Green added 15 points, nine rebounds, eight assists, one steal and two blocked shots. Livingston finished with 16 points, three rebounds, three assists and only one turnover in 28 minutes of action. Brandon Rush was the spark off the bench and added 15 points on 6 - of - 8 shooting. The Warriors will either play the Portland Trail Blazers or the Los Angeles Clippers (Blazers lead series 3 - 2).

It was a true collective effort for New York, particularly after losing superstar Carmelo Anthony in the second half due to an ankle sprain. Several of his teammates, both starters and reserves, stepped in to help make up the scoring shortfall caused by the All-Star\\'s absence, and the Knicks finished the night with outstanding 53 percent shooting from the field.

Such was the case Wednesday, when Philadelphia came in without standout rookie Jahlil Okafor due to his shin injury, and as losers of nine straight games. However, they hung tough with the playoff - contending Hornets, entering the final period trailing only 83 - 74. However, a 9 - 2 run by Charlotte beginning at the 9:15 mark of the fourth quarter opened up a 16 - point lead for the home team that allowed them some breathing room. Although Philadelphia kept coming, the Hornets were able to outscore them 24 - 19 the rest of the way to secure the double - digit win. The Hornets saw four starters and one reserve tally double - digit scoring, and were led for a second consecutive night by Kemba Walker. He managed 30 points, seven rebounds, two assists and two steals. Cody Zeller amassed only half of Walker's point total but it was enough to place him second in team scoring for the night, as he put together a stat line of 15 points, six rebounds, two assists and four blocks. Marvin Williams posted a near double - double with 14 points, nine rebounds, a steal and two blocks. Nicolas Batum was also productive, collecting 12 points, seven assists, four rebounds and a pair of steals. Jeremy Lin paced the reserves with 14 points, four rebounds and a pair of assists. Charlotte remains in third place in the Eastern Conference's Southeast Division and currently has a hold of the sixth seed in the conference as well. They head back home to face the Indiana Pacers on Friday night. The Sixers received a trio of 17 - point efforts from their short - handed starting five, a key factor in their ability to keep the game competitive throughout. The most productive of the three performances came from Robert Covington, who added nine boards, three assists, a steal and two blocks. Nerlens Noel supplemented his points with four assists, three rebounds and a pair of steals. Isaiah Canaan was only able to add two steals to his point tally, but now is three - for - three in producing double - digit scoring in his latest string of starting opportunities. Ish Smith finished with a well - rounded line of 12 points, eight assists, five rebounds, a steal and a block. Hollis Thompson led the bench with 10 points, two rebounds and an assist.

While Kyle Korver has struggled throughout the season, he did pitch in an important three - pointer that broke a 84 - 84 tie midway through the fourth quarter. Paul Millsap drained a long ball a few possessions later to all but sink the Blazers hopes with just over two minutes left.

Unfortuantely, a lack luster start to the season had them at 4 - 7 entering the day, and the Rockets decided they needed to light a spark under the team. They responded accordingly with their fourth quarter rally, which could potentially be looked back at as a turning point in their season. As usual, Portland was led by Damian Lillard who scored a team high 23 points on 6 - 19 shooting from the field. C.J. McCollum, Al-Farouq Aminu, and Allen Crabbe also chipped in with double - digit point totals. Along with Aminu\\'s 16 points, he also added 15 rebounds in 37 minutes. The Trailblazers fell to 4 - 9 with the loss and will look to bounce back Friday when they welcome the Clippers to town. James Harden nealry had a monster triple double for the Rockets with 45 points (11 - 29 FG, 4 - 15 3PT, 19 - 20 FT), eight rebounds, 11 assists, and five steals in 47 minutes. Trevor Ariza and Corey Brewer each added 18 and 16 points respectively, while Dwight Howard scored seven points and grabbed 19 boards. Houston will look to carry their momentum into Friday\\'s game in Memphis. Table format: There are two tables. The first table has six columns and two rows.

The Raptors (5 - 2) did not get off to a hot start in this contest, allowing the Thunder (6 - 2) to go on a 120 run in the first four and half minutes of the game. Toronto, however, kept their composure and continued to whittle away at the lead from there, ultimately snagging a seven - point lead by halftime. They never lost that lead, as the play of their All-Star backcourt of Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan proved to be too much for the Thunder to handle. Lowry nearly had a triple - double, recording 19 points, 13 assists and nine rebounds in an astonishing 43 minutes, while DeRozan continues to be the league's top scorer, as he posted 37 points Wednesday — his sixth 30 - point performance in seven games. For the Thunder, they lost their first home game of the season despite another stat - stuffing performance from Russell Westbrook, who recorded 36 points, seven rebounds and seven assists on the night. The problem for Westbrook, however, is that he shot just 9 - of - 26 from the field, 3 - of - 12 from behind the arc and committed eight turnovers, leading to an overall sloppy performance from the All-Star point guard. Beyond Westbrook, just Victor Oladipo and Steven Adams managed to score in double figures, with 18 and 14 points respectively, but Adams did add 12 rebounds, giving him his second double - double of the season.

Scoring was not an issue for the Thunder, and their only issue on the defensive end was containing DeMarcus Cousins, who was a force in the paint.

Rondo almost matched Westbrook with a triple - double, falling one rebound shy of the achievement, and finished with 11 points, nine rebounds and 12 assists in 36 minutes. The NBA leading assists per game guard caused some slight controversy at the end of the first half, as he stalled the inbound pass on back - to - back possessions, which led to to two delay of game calls that send Kevin Durant to the free throw line for two easy buckets. DeMarcus Cousins added to the heated matchup after he got tangled up with Durant in the first quarter, as the two all - stars needed to be separated before anything escalated too quickly. Cousins led all scorers to the tune of 35 points, to go along with 12 rebounds and three assists.

The Jazz did most of their damage in the paint, winning the points in the paint differential, 58 - 44. This was a wire - to - wire win for the Jazz, as they held a double - digit lead for the final 15 minutes. The Jazz (33 - 19) have n\\'t had all their pieces fully healthy much this season, but a win like this shows how scary they can be at full tilt.

Derrick Favors had one of his best games of the season, totaling 20 points, 10 rebounds, three steals and two blocks on 10 - of - 12 shooting. George Hill finished second on the team in scoring, collecting 22 points, four rebounds and eight assists. Rudy Gobert was the only other Jazz player in double figures, as he provided 14 points, six rebounds, three assists and three blocks. The Hawks (30 - 22) have been inconsistent all season and blowout losses like this at home are head scratchers to say the least. Dennis Schroder carried the load, as he amassed 21 points, two rebounds and two assists. Paul Millsap went just 4 - of - 14 from the field, but finished with 14 points, eight rebounds and three assists.

The Knicks had a double - digit lead after a 32 - point first quarter and it was downhill after that. The Hawks outscored them by 22 points over the second and third quarter and ran away with an easy win. The key was the second half defense, as the Hawks allowed just 35 points over the final 24 minutes. Both teams shot well, as they both shot over 48 percent from the field with Atlanta shooting 53 percent. The turnovers were the difference in the game though, as the Knicks committed 22 to the Hawks nine. No Knicks player scored more than 18 points and they were absolutely shut down in the second half. Carmelo Anthony was the only player who showed signs of life, as he recorded a 18 point - 12 rebound double - double. The Knicks are in a rough stretch right now and it\\'s hard to imagine it getting better with this lack of offense. They\\'ll look to play better on Sunday against the Boston Celtics in the back end of a back - to - back. The Hawks were sick of their bad defense in the first half and shut down this weak offense to pull away with an impressive win. The frontcourt was spectacular tonight for Atlanta, as Al Horford, Paul Millsap and Mike Scott all played well. Mike Scott scored 18 points off the bench and Horford and Millsap stuffed the stat sheet. In fact, Millsap and Horford combined for 41 points, 13 rebounds, 14 assists, five steals, and three blocks.

In a rematch of the Eastern Conference Finals from last season, the Cavaliers showed once again who's boss. Cleveland took a 15 - point lead at half and never looked back. The defense was the key for the Cavs on Saturday, as they held Atlanta to 37 percent shooting and outrebounded them 51 - 38. LeBron James, Tristan Thompson and Kevin Love all recorded double - digit rebounds against one of the worst rebounding teams in the league. The Hawks had a very frustrating game on Saturday, as Coach Mike Budenholzer was tossed in the third quarter. The ejection was a bit innocuous, but his frustration clearly boiled over. No Atlanta player scored more than 14 points in the loss and no one could fine their stroke against this vaunted Cleveland defense. The Hawks were led by another strong outing from Paul Millsap, who collected 14 points, 12 rebounds, five assists, four steals and two blocks in the defeat. Millsap is proving to be one of the best stat - stuffers in the NBA right now and arguably one of the best power forwards in the association. Jeff Teague did return for this game, but came off the bench to ease him in from his ankle injury. The Hawks will look to play better om Tuesday when they host the surging Boston Celtics. Cleveland played their first game without center Timofey Mozgov and they didn’t miss a beat. Tristan Thompson filled - in for him and had a spectacular game, tallying nine points, 16 rebounds and five assists in the win. There wasn’t much bench depth for the Cavs in this game, but all four players who played at least two minutes off the bench scored at least six points. LeBron James didn’t have great numbers at the half, but he finished strong by totaling 19 points, 11 rebounds and eight assists in the victory. Kevin Love also provided 25 points and 11 rebounds in what's proving to be a bounce - back season for the All-Star.

The Celtics guard has been shooting well all season, but has taken his game up a notch over his last three contests, all starts. Bradley has posted three consecutive performances of 21 points or greater, shooting an outstanding 58 percent from the field over that span. Wednesday, he collected 25 points on 10 - for - 17 shooting, including four buckets from beyond the arc. The three - pointers give Bradley 11 combined over his last two games. Unfortunately for Boston, the rest of their starters couldn’t provide their scorching shooting guard much support. Isaiah Thomas shook off two early turnovers in the first quarter to tally 14 points, a pair of assists, and three steals, but was the only other member of the starting five to post double - digit scoring. Jared Sullinger (seven points) and Jae Crowder (six points) mustered single - digit points for the second consecutive game, while Amir Johnson managed four points and seven rebounds. Encouragingly, rookie hopeful R.J. Hunter paced the Boston bench with a career - high 12 points, while David Lee also pitched in 10 points, six rebounds, three assists and a pair of steals. Given their respective recent performances, Lee may soon find himself back in the starting rotation in Johnson’s stead. The Celtics fell to 7 - 7 and currently reside in third place in the Eastern Conference’s Atlantic Division. They head home for a Wednesday tilt versus the Sixers. The Hawks are known as one of the most balanced offensive teams in the league, and the performance of their starting five Tuesday was a testament to that reputation. All of Atlanta’s starters tallied double - digit scoring performances, with Paul Millsap spearheading the effort with a 25 - point, nine - rebound, three - assist night. Jeff Teague complemented Millsap with an efficient performance in his second game back from an ankle injury, collecting 16 points and nine assists. Thabo Sefolosha acquitted himself very well in his spot start with 15 points, a total matched by guard Kyle Korver. Al Horford pitched in 11 points, four rebounds, and four assists in a game that his frontcourt mate largely took over. Mike Scott paced the Atlanta bench with 15 points of his own, a season high. Atlanta also notably shot an outstanding 50 percent from beyond the three - point line, led by Korver’s trio of long - range buckets. The Hawks improved to 10 - 6 and currently reside in second place in the Eastern Conference’s Southeast Division, a half - game behind the Heat.

The Hornets (25 - 33) have been playing without the services of starting center Cody Zeller since late January due to his calf injury, but his absence has come with a silver lining. Second-year big man Frank Kaminsky III had taken the opportunity afforded him and parlayed it into a string of impressive performances, with the most recent having come in Saturday\\'s contest against the new - look Kings (25 - 34). Kaminsky posted a 23 - point, 13 - rebound double - double that also included three assists and two steals to lead the way for Charlotte, his fifth straight double - digit scoring effort and third double - double in the last seven contests.

Marvin Williams followed Kaminsky with 16 points, six rebounds, two steals and one block. Nicolas Batum was next with 15 points, six boards, three assists, one steal and one block. Marco Belinelli paced the bench with 13 points, six assists, two rebounds and one steal. Kemba Walker provided 12 points, six assists, three rebounds and one steal in a supporting role that was somewhat uncharacteristic. Michael Kidd-Gilchrist could n\\'t muster much on the scoreboard with only six points but made up for it by hauling in 12 boards. With Cousins now in New Orleans, it could well be a different player taking the offensive lead every night in Sacramento. Saturday was Ben McLemore\\'s turn, as the two - guard led the way with 18 points, two rebounds and one steal. Newly-acquired Buddy Hield had his second strong effort in as many games in a Kings uniform, posting a bench - leading 15 points, as well as two assists and one rebound. Anthony Tolliver and Tyreke Evans produced matching 11 - point efforts, with the latter making his debut in the starting five. Tolliver added four boards and one assist, while Evans supplemented his scoring with five rebounds, five assists and a pair of blocks. Darren Collison was quiet by his standards, offering a modest 10 points, along with five assists, two rebounds and one steal. Promising rookie Skal Labissiere, now part of the rotation in the wake of Cousins\\' departure, supplied eight points, 13 rebounds, one assist and one steal in 23 minutes off the bench.

Continuing to run with the starters, Brook Lopez recorded 15 points (7 - 14 FG, 1 - 4 FT), nine rebounds and three blocked shots in 25 minutes. He came just shy of posting his third double - double in a row, as he\\'s averaging 18 points and 11 rebounds over his last three games. Also doing his best to keep the Nets in this game was Jarrett Jack, who came off the bench for 15 points (5 - 9 FG, 1 - 3 3Pt, 4 - 5 FT) and three assists. He looked to be the more effective guard for the Nets tonight, as Deron Williams (3 - 10 FG, 0 - 2 3Pt 4 - 4 FT) struggled to just 10 points. Also struggling offensively was Thaddeus Young, who finished with 10 points (4 - 14 FG, 1 - 2 3Pt, 1 - 2 FT) and six rebounds in 27 minutes. He had shot over 50 percent in nine out of his last ten games prior to Tuesday, but has now shot under 40 percent in two out of his last three. Also off the bench, Bojan Bogdanovic added 12 points (5 - 7 FG, 2 - 3 3Pt) and an assist in just 17 minutes.

That could mean the team looks at moving some of their veteran players later this season. The Timberwolves will have another great test Friday when they host the Oklahoma City Thunder. Portland had their five - game win streak snapped with the loss.

The Spurs outshot the Kings from the free - throw line, three - point range and from the field while also winning the turnover battle 15 - 9. Rim protection was huge as well, with San Antonio recording eight blocks and Sacramento failing to swat away a single shot. The Spurs (20) have handed over the reins to Kawhi Leonard and it was evident in this game. Leonard finished with 30 points, five assists, three rebounds and five steals in the victory. At one point, he recorded three steals and 10 points in a span where the Spurs were able to create a double - digit lead spanning between the third and fourth quarters. LaMarcus Aldridge was second on the team, as he scored 16 points to go along with his five boards. Dewayne Dedmon and David Lee came off the bench to score 12 a piece.

While the Thunder were down 57 - 51 at half, they had a huge second half where they out - scored the Pelicans 51 - 34, allowing them to steal a victory over the Pelicans. It was a big win, as they will be fighting against the Pelicans to secure one of the last spots in the Western Conference playoffs moving forward. With Kevin Durant still sitting out with a toe injury, Russell Westbrook again took it on himself to do the bulk of the work offensively for the Thunder. Westbrook went 18 - for - 31 from the field and 2 - for - 6 from the three - point line to score a game - high of 45 points, while also adding six rebounds and six assists.

While these teams have struggled throughout the season, they left it all on the floor in this close fought battle. In fact, there were 15 lead changes and 15 ties, with no team leading by more than nine points. Orlando took advantage of their opportunities, as they took 14 more shots than Brooklyn. The reason for that were turnovers and offensive rebounding, as they won the turnover battle, 17 - 7, and the offensive rebounding, 13 - 6.

Nikola Vucevic made his return from a back injury to drop 21 points, 10 rebounds, four assists and three blocks off the bench. Evan Fournier also scored 21 points, adding four rebounds to his tally.

Dwight Howard had a nice game as well, posting a double - double with 21 points (9 - 14 FG, 3 - 12 FT) and 16 rebounds.

Defense carried Chicago all night long, as they held Cleveland to 41 percent from the field and 32 percent from three - point range. The assist - to - turnover ratio was decisive as well, with the Bulls recording 10 more assists than the Cavaliers, while committing two less turnovers. The Bulls (18 - 18) have been playing terribly recently, but a road win against the Cavaliers is just what they need to get going. Jimmy Butler struggled through the first three quarters, but finished the game with 20 points, six rebounds and eight assists, with 14 of those points coming in the fourth quarter. Taj Gibson went 9 - of - 10 from the field to collect 18 points and seven rebounds. Doug McDermott and Nikola Mirotic came off the bench to combine for 33 points and 10 rebounds.

Jordan McRae got the start for Irving and accrued 21 points, three rebounds, two assists and two blocks in the loss.

With their season on the line, the Clippers were able to hold off the Spurs on the road to force Game 7 on Saturday. Offensive basket interference helped seal the win for the Spurs in Game 5, but that same infraction helped the Clippers finish with the victory Thursday. Boris Diaw interfered on a three - point attempt from Marco Belinelli that would have cut San Antonio\\'s deficit to one point with one second remaining, all but extinguishing its chances to complete the comeback. The Clippers were led once again by Chris Paul and Blake Griffin. Paul finished with 19 points and 15 rebounds while Griffin had 26 points and 12 rebounds. Game 7 will take place Saturday at the Staples Center in Los Angeles. Los Angeles faced elimination in Game 6 after taking a tough four - point loss at home Tuesday, but managed to extend the series to a definitive Game 7. In addition to Paul and Griffin\\'s big outings, DeAndre Jordan posted a double - double with 15 points and 14 rebounds. The Clippers\\' bench took a potential hit, however, as Glen Davis exited the game with a left ankle sprain and did not return. If he is unable to go for Game 7, Blake Griffin will have to log heavy minutes once again after playing 41 minutes Thursday. San Antonio committed 13 turnovers and no starter scored more than 12 points. Rising star Kawhi Leonard had a tough night shooting, going 3 - for - 15 from the floor and finished with 12 points.

The Nuggets finished as the superior shooters in this game, going 56 percent from the field and 36 percent from the three - point line, while the Kings went 51 percent from the floor and just 28 percent from deep. The Nuggets also came out with the advantage on the boards, out - rebounding the Kings 43 - 32. While it was a high scoring game, both teams were quite sloppy with the ball, as the Nuggets recorded 18 turnovers and the Kings finished with 20. Kenneth Faried had another excellent showing as the Nuggets continued to use their small lineup with him at the center position. Faried went an impressive 12 - for - 14 from the field and 6 - for - 8 from the free throw line to score a game - high of 30 points, while also chipping in with seven rebounds and three steals. He\\'s really picked up his play of late and is averaging 24 points and 6 rebounds over his last three games. Wilson Chandler also did his part in the win as well and finished with 21 points (8 - 15 FG, 3 - 6 3Pt, 2 - 2 FT), nine rebounds and three steals.

Casspi nearly triple - doubled with 22 points (8 - 13 FG, 1 - 3 3Pt, 5 - 8 FT), seven rebounds and seven assists, while McLemore finished with 20 points (6 - 12 FG, 2 - 5 3Pt, 6 - 8 FT), seven assists and four steals. Casspi has taken it on himself to make up for the Kings\\' injury issues of late, as he\\'s now averaging 21 points and 6 rebounds over his last four games. McLemore has struggled with his consistency all season long, so it\\'s also a very positive sign for the Kings that he\\'s recorded three solid performances in a row. Ray McCallum shot the ball well Sunday, going 6 - for - 10 from the field and 1 - for - 2 from the three - point line to score 14 points, while also adding three assists.

In fact, the Timberwolves won the second quarter 28 - 15, while the Hornets responded with a 36 - 17 third quarter of their own.

Charlotte also dominated in the lane, scoring 50 paint points to the Timberwolves\\' 28. There were nine ties and 16 lead changes in total.

Ricky Rubio flirted with a triple - double, accumulating 11 points, eight rebounds and eight assists in the loss.

Postseason-ending injuries to Chris Paul and Blake Griffin clearly turned the tide of this series, despite the fact that the Clippers had some experienced and able replacements for them. Austin Rivers and Jamal Crawford were both highly productive Friday, with the latter actually leading all scorers with 32 points, along with an assist and three steals. However, the Blazers saw their All-Star point guard Damian Lillard bounce back from a pair of modest efforts over the last two games. He paced the Portland attack with 28 points, seven assists, five rebounds and a steal, and they needed every one of his points by game\\'s end. The Clippers tied matters up at 103 after two free throws by Crawford with 32 seconds left. However, Mason Plumlee was able to draw a loose ball foul from Jeff Green, and sank the two subsequent free throws with 14 seconds remaining to give Portland a lead they would n\\'t surrender. Crawford added an assist and three steals to his team - high point total. Rivers followed with 21 points, eight assists, six rebounds and a steal. DeAndre Jordan contributed a 15 - point, 20 - rebound double - double with an assist and two steals. J.J. Redick was next with 15 points, a rebound and an assist.

Maurice Harkless collected 14 points, three rebounds, an assist and a steal. Al-Farouq Aminu tallied 10 points, six rebounds and two assists.

In a battle of the Morris twins, Detroit and Marcus Morris ended up the victor, though brother Markieff performed admirably for Phoenix. Usually the better free - throw shooting team comes away with the win, but Detroit somehow prevailed while shooting just 50 percent from the charity stripe, lowlighted by a 2 - for - 11 effort from big man Andre Drummond. It very well may have been a case of how many times each team got to the free - throw line, as Detroit took 36 free - throws compared to Phoenix\\'s 13 attempts. The Pistons continued their fantastic form Friday and look like a major threat to make the playoffs for the first time since 2008 - 9. The success this season has to be attributed to Andre Drummond and Reggie Jackson. Drummond put together a 12 - point, 17 - rebound performance in the win, which actually brought down his season average to around 19 rebounds a game. Reggie Jackson put together an all - around fantastic line as well, as he tallied 22 points, seven assists and six rebounds in the victory. Marcus Morris tallied 18 points and six rebounds. If these three continue to play at this level, they are a serious threat in the Eastern Conference this season. Detroit\\'s next game comes on Sunday in Portland against the surprising Trail Blazers. The Suns fell down by seven in a 14 - point first quarter, and they simply couldn’t bounce back after that. Phoenix was once again led by its guards, Eric Bledsoe and Brandon Knight, who totaled a combined 44 points, seven assists, and four steals in the loss. Markieff Morris matched his brother\\'s scoring total by amassing 18 points and four rebounds in the defeat. The last two losses for Phoenix have been against the Los Angeles Clippers and Detroit Pistons, and that may be due to the fact that those teams have two of the best rim protectors in the NBA. Phoenix will be in for another tough game on Sunday when they have to travel to Oklahoma City to take on the Thunder and their own dominant shot blocker in Serge Ibaka.

After finishing the third quarter down 75 - 66, the Suns made a fourth quarter run, out - scoring the Grizzlies 35 - 26 to tie the game at 101 with five seconds left in the game, eventually pushing it to overtime. After Eric Bledsoe missed a game - winner in the first overtime, it went to a second, where the Suns went ice cold from the field and were out - scored 14 - 2 to close out the game. The Grizzlies were able to out - rebound the Suns 54 - 46, giving them a slight advantage in this one. In his second game back from a nine - game absence, Zach Randolph went off, going 11 - for - 16 from the field and 5 - for - 6 from the free throw line to score 27 points, while also adding 17 rebounds and two blocked shots.

The game was well out of hand early, as they led 39 - 19 after the first quarter, won the second quarter 30 - 22 and won the third quarter 35 to 31. The 28 - point halftime lead was the Pacers high of the season and it shows how much motivation they had coming into this game.

The Hawks got off to a slow start in this one, falling behind nine points by the end of the first half. They had some fight left in them, though, exploding out in the second half, where they out - scored the Pelicans 59 - 42 the rest of the game to seal the eight - point victory in front of their home crowd. Despite shooting lower percentages from the field, the Hawks made up for it on the defensive side of the ball, forcing the Pelicans into 19 turnovers as a team. The Hawks\\' frontcourt duo of Al Horford and Paul Millsap did the majority of the damage to the injury - plagued Pelicans. Without Anthony Davis defending in the post, they were able to take the advantage down low. Horford was the main beneficiary and went an efficient 11 - for - 15 from the field and 4 - for - 6 from the three - point line for a game - high of 26 points, while also adding eight rebounds and three blocked shots. Horford shot below 40 percent in each of his last two games, so Wednesday\\'s showing was a nice bounce - back effort for the center. Millsap, on the other hand, posted an impressive 19 - point (6 - 14 FG, 0 - 2 3Pt, 7 - 8 FT), 16 - rebound double - double of his own. It marked his fourth double - double of the season, pushing his season averages to 17 points and 9 rebounds per game. Jeff Teague chipped in with 14 points (6 - 16 FG, 1 - 2 3Pt, 1 - 2 FT) and 10 assists as well. Davis (hip), Jrue Holiday (lower leg) and Tyreke Evans (knee) all remained sidelined Wednesday. Without Davis\\' normal production, both Ish Smith and Eric Gordon took it on themselves to make up for his absence. Gordon went 10 - for - 20 from the field and 4 - for - 6 from the three - point line for 26 points in 31 minutes. The points were a new season - high for the seventh - year guard out of Indiana, who\\'s now surpassed the 20 - point plateau in four of his last five games. Smith finished with 18 points (8 - 17 FG, 2 - 4 3Pt) and 10 assists over 39 minutes. He had 16 of those 18 points in the first half, but really cooled down in the second, letting Gordon take over for the most part. Filling in for Davis at power forward, Ryan Andersen added a productive 17 points (7 - 16 FG, 2 - 5 3Pt, 1 - 1 FT) and 11 rebounds.

James Harden provided a major spark to the offense during the second half, combined with Montrezl Harrell\\'s boost on defense, and the result was a Rockets win. Harden finished with 30 points, five rebounds and seven assists on 9 - of - 25 shooting. Dwight Howard added 16 points and 13 rebounds, while Harrell\\'s defensive prowess was only highlighted statistically by his plus/minus of nine. The Rockets were dealing with an onslaught of injuries heading into the game. Ty Lawson (ankle), Donatas Motiejunas (back) and Marcus Thornton (personal reasons) were unavailable for Houston in the win. The Jazz were unable to execute their second half game plan down the stretch, and once James Harden got going, there was not much any defense can do to stop the current second best scorer in the league. Injuries also riddled Utah heading into Monday, as Derrick Favors (back) was sidelined. The bright side to Favors\\' injury is the playing time that Trey Lyles has been seeing in his absence. The Kentucky product and No. 12 pick in the draft, Lyles finished with 13 points in 20 minutes on 6 - of - 10 shooting.

The home team also clamped down on defense in the second half, allowing only 47 points following intermission after surrendering 62 in the first half.

Lillard's success rate from the field (56 percent) was his best since a 56 percent figure on Nov. 2 against the Timberwolves. Backcourt mate C.J.

The Heat also received excellent production off the bench from Gerald Green, who poured in 17 points and helped make up for some of the offensive shortfall that resulted from the ejection of point guard Goran Dragic early in the fourth quarter for arguing calls with the referees.

Channing Frye and Trey Lyles were both ejected with four minutes remaining in the fourth quarter after Lyles appeared to elbow Frye below the belt. The frustration was beginning to overcome Cleveland, although the timing could not have been worse seeing as they just ripped off seven straight points to bring the Jazz lead within striking distance. Kyrie Irving shot his team out of many opportunities, but the poor shot selection was not entirely on the point guard, as the Cavs shot just under 40 percent as a unit. Irving finished with 15 points on 7 - of - 23 shooting, to go along with four rebounds and three assists. LeBron James rounded out the box score, and did provide a dunk of the year candidate after finishing a lob pass from J.R. Smith. James finished with 23 points, 12 rebounds and three assists on 10 - of - 20 shooting. The Jazz were unable to stop the Cavs from getting decent looks at the basket, but just the right amount of defense was in play to give them the edge late in the game. The Utah backcourt was out to impress against the Eastern Conference’s best team, as Rodney Hood and Shelvin Mack both provided some of their best games of the season. Mack almost completed a triple - double after scoring 17 points, to go along with seven rebounds and 10 assists on 7 - of - 14 shooting. Rodney Hood matched Mack’s efficient game with a game high 28 points including four buckets from behind the arc. Before his ejection, Trey Lyles added double figures off the bench. The win came without the Jazz’s best player in Gordon Hayward (foot), who is likely to miss out on a few more games with the nagging injury.

Despite securing the victory, the Cavliers were out - shot in this matchup. The Pistons went 42 percent from the field and 33 percent from the three - point line, while the Cavaliers went 42 percent from the field and just 27 percent from beyond the arc. The Cavaliers were also out - rebounded 51 - 47 by the Pistons. Where the Cavaliers gained the advantage though was in turnovers, as they forced the Pistons into 18 turnovers, while committing only nine of their own. It was just enough of an advantage, that it may have been the difference that pushed them to a win. Kyrie Irving and LeBron James were unstoppable Tuesday, combining for 70 of the Cavaliers\\' 103 total points. Irving led the team with 38 points (13 - 23 FG, 6 - 10 3Pt, 6 - 6 FT), while also adding six assists and three steals. He\\'s now combined for 59 points over his last two games, as he\\'s been a big part in the Cavaliers\\' seven - game win streak.

He\\'s been on an absolute tear lately, averaging 30 points during their last seven wins. While James and Irving had huge outings, the third member of the big three, Kevin Love, did n\\'t have his best game. He struggled with his shot, scoring only seven points (3 - 11 FG, 1 - 8 3Pt), but did at least add eight rebounds as well. Starting at point guard, D.J. Augustin was the a big reason the Pistons were able to keep this game close. Augustin nearly double - doubled, finishing with 19 points (8 - 15 FG, 3 - 6 3Pt), nine assists and two steals. In the two games since Brandon Jennings went down with a season - ending injury, Augustin has combined for 54 points and 17 assists. Both Greg Monroe and Andre Drummond had strong showings as well, with each notching a double - double of their own. Monroe had 17 points (7 - 15 FG, 3 - 3 FT) and 12 rebounds, while Drummond had 12 points (6 - 17 FG, 0 - 4 FT), 17 rebounds and six blocked shots.

The Celtics had a big first half, out - scoring the Hawks 66 - 50, but were unable to keep their momentum going into the third quarter, and allowed the Hawks to come all the way back and take the victory. Despite being out - rebounded 42 - 31, the Hawks were still able to force the Celtics into 23 turnovers, giving them enough of an advantage to grab a four - point victory. Kyle Korver was almost impossible to stop in this one. He shot a ridiculous 8 - for - 9 from the floor and 6 - for - 7 from beyond the arc to finish with a team - high of 24 points. Considering he\\'s averaging 13 points on the year, it was a nice surprise for the Hawks to get some extra offensive production out of Korver. Paul Millsap played a big role in the win as well, as he recorded 19 points, six rebounds and seven assists.

Green has really struggled from the three - point line in the past two weeks, but has still been able to keep his season scoring average at 18 points per game. Jared Sullinger had an efficient game. He scored 22 points (9 - 16 FG, 4 - 7 3Pt) and grabbed nine rebounds in 29 minutes. After struggling against the Spurs on Sunday, it was a nice confidence builder for Sullinger. Rajon Rondo struggled with his shot all night and finished with only two points. He did all of the other things right though and contributed a ridiculous 19 assists and 12 rebounds.

The Lakers will have a chance to extend their win streak on the road against the Minnesota Timberwolves on Sunday. San Antonio has dropped two of their last three games. Kawhi Leonard\\'s (hand) absence meant a drop - off in defense for the Spurs on Friday, but they also welcomed back Tony Parker (hamstring), Tim Duncan (rest) and Manu Ginobili (rest) to the active roster. The Spurs coughed up an uncharacteristic 19 turnovers in the game, giving up 25 easy points off the loss of possessions. Tiago Splitter (calf) played in a second straight game, earning a season - high 15 minutes of run off the bench.

The Thunder were letting the Suns hang around in the first half, but pulled away after that, out - scoring the Suns 64 - 49 in the second half. This was a domination in every fashion for the Thunder, as they recorded more assists, rebounds, steals and blocks than the Suns in the victory. The Suns bit themselves in the foot as well, committing 23 turnovers in the defeat. The Thunder did what they do best as they led by double - doubles from superstars Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook on Sunday. Durant tallied 32 points and 11 rebounds, while Westbrook totaled 21 points and 13 assists. They also combined for seven steals and it\\'s clear that this is the best tandem in the NBA at this point. Oklahoma City also got some nice production off the bench, as Enes Kanter and Dion Waiters both scored 19 points in the victory. The 4 - 3 record doesn’t look too great, but it sounds much better when you look deeper and see that the losses came to the Toronto Raptors, Chicago Bulls and Houston Rockets, who are all top - notch contenders this season. The Thunder play the Washington Wizards on Tuesday in their next game in a homecoming for Durant. The Suns got a brilliant performance from Eric Bledsoe on Sunday, but got very little aside from that. Bledsoe tallied 28 points and 11 assists in the loss and he is looking like one of the best guards in the NBA at this point. One positive that the Suns can take out of the loss is a 17 - point performance from T. J. Warren from off the bench, as he continues to develop as a great sixth man. With the recent struggles of starter P.J. Tucker, Phoenix very well may opt to switch to Warren in an effort to boost the offense. The Suns have a few days off until they host the Los Angeles Clippers on Thursday in their next matchup. Table format: There are two tables.   The first table is about teams.

Strong ball movement and shooting helped propel the Celtics to victory, as Miami was characteristically tenacious on the glass.

Thomas, the league's second - leading scorer, dropped 30 points on the night. Crowder, meanwhile, had a season - high 25 points including three huge three - pointers. Crowder was also immensely impactful on the defensive end, coming away with two blocks and two steals. Miami (35 - 38), meanwhile, has been surging lately, pushing their way to the playoff picture after a dismal 13 - 30 start to the season. On Sunday, the Heat showed the intensity that led them to their playoff push, out - rebounding the Celtics by seven and coming away with 16 forced turnovers. Center Hassan Whiteside was at the heart of the win, scoring 19 points to go along with 15 rebounds. The Heat also enjoyed bench production in droves, with sixth man Tyler Johnson coming away with a team - high 24 points off the bench.

Instead, the Warriors were able to out - score the Heat 23 - 11 in the fourth quarter, giving them their sixth victory in a row. They were also able to shoot 57 percent from the field in this game, while the Heat struggled and shot only 39 percent from the floor.

Ever since Bradley Beal was diagnosed with the initial stages of a stress fracture in his lower right fibula on December 12, the Wizards have been even more reliant than usual on All-Star point guard John Wall. The 25 - year - old has responded well with 20 - and - 26 - point efforts in two of the three games since, but his own health was in question heading into Saturday's contest. Wall had sprained an ankle in Friday's practice, and there had been some doubt shortly thereafter as to whether he'd be healthy enough to take the court. With Otto Porter already ruled out for the game with a thigh bruise, the Wizards were facing the grim possibility of taking on a talented Hornets squad without three starters. However, Wall answered the bell and shook off the ankle tweak to post his fifth straight double - double performance. He amassed 27 points, 12 assists, four rebounds, three steals and a block over 42 outstanding minutes to lead Washington to an important Eastern Conference victory. Charlotte received a balance offensive effort from their starters, with Kemba Walker leading the way with 18 points, three rebounds, two assists and three steals. Nicolas Batum, who'd missed Charlotte's last game with an illness, came back to contribute across the stat sheet, tallying 14 points, eight assists, six rebounds, three steals and a block. Cody Zeller and P.J. Hairston were the other two starters in double digits, with 11 and 10 points, respectively. Marvin Williams was the only Hornets starter to score under ten points, but still came within a point and an assist of a double - double. Jeremy Lin followed up his stellar 35 - point effort as a starter in Batum's stead on Thursday with a 15 - point outing that paced the Hornets bench. The Hornets fell to 15 - 11 and are now in a second - place tie with the Orlando Magic in the Eastern Conference's Southeast Division. They travel to Houston to face the Rockets on Monday. In addition to Wall's memorable performance, the Wizards also got quality play from the fill - ins for their two injured starters. Kelly Oubre, Jr. did a solid job replacing Otto Porter for the evening, managing eight points, five rebounds and a block over 22 minutes. Meanwhile, Garrett Temple, who'd turned in sub - par efforts in Bradley Beal's stead in the first three games as his replacement, exploded for a season - high 21 points (on a season - best 78 shooting percentage from the field), five rebounds, three assists and two blocks. Jared Dudley (19 points, nine rebounds, four assists, two steals) and Marcin Gortat (18 points, six rebounds, an assist, a steal and four blocks) rounded out what was an outstanding night for the Washington starters. With such productive outings from their front - line players, the Wizards only needed 16 points from their bench in the victory. Washington improved to 11 - 14 but remains in last place in the Eastern Conference's Southeast Division. They face off against the Sacramento Kings at home on Monday.

The Grizzlies had a nightmare game from three - point range, as they went just 3 - for - 20. The Nuggets also outrebounded the Grizzlies 40 - 27.

However, the Sixers (7 - 23) stormed out of intermission to take the third quarter by a 30 - 19 margin, leaving them with a seven - point lead heading into the final period. Sacramento then turned the tables in the fourth, and DeMarcus Cousins made sure the visitors did n\\'t prevail. First, the mercurial big man sunk a 26 - foot three - point jumper with 20 seconds left to give the Kings a 99 - 97 lead. He subsequently netted one of two free throws with five seconds remaining to extend the advantage to three, and then stuffed a 25 - foot shot attempt by the Sixers\\' Joel Embiid with three ticks on the clock. Embiid managed to get his hands on the ball again in time to hoist a 28 - footer a second later, but the home team was assured the win when that shot failed to find the net.

San Antonio opened up a early lead and managed to hang on throughout the contest, and it was thanks in large part to yet another great performance from Leonard. Leonard finished with a game - high 31 points in 10 - of - 24 shooting to go along with five rebounds and four assists in 39 minutes. And it was Leonard and the other four starters that managed to carry the team, as those five ended up scoring 78 of the team\\'s 107 points. In the end, it was the Spurs\\' hot shooting from outside that won them Monday\\'s contest, as they shot a scorching 47 percent as a team from behind the arc. For the Hawks (37 - 30), the loss ended a three - game winning streak, and they did not have the same sort of success from three. The team finished shooting just 27 percent from behind the arc, with the starting five going just 1 - of - 9 from deep.

Davis made a strong return from his recent shoulder injury by posting his fifth double - double of the campaign, while Anderson managed a second consecutive 30 - point performance in just 33 minutes. The Spurs looked poised to dominate as expected in the early going, opening up the game with a quick 80 lead. LaMarcus Aldridge and Kawhi Leonard lead the way with 20 and 22 points, respectively, but no other San Antonio starter managed much of an impact. Tim Duncan notably struggled against a New Orleans defense that had generally been vulnerable against centers, collecting only six points, two assists, and a steal over 19 minutes. San Antonio fell to 9 - 3 but remains in first place in the Western Conference’s Southwest Division. They head home for a showdown versus the Grizzlies on Saturday. For the home team, Davis tallied 20 points and 18 rebounds in an intriguing matchup against LaMarcus Aldridge. Eric Gordon had less of an offensive role with Davis in the lineup, but still pitched in with 11 points, two assists, a rebound, and a pair of steals. In addition to Anderson’s outstanding efforts, Ish Smith also represented the Pelicans bench extremely well, tallying 17 points and 13 assists in 33 minutes. It marked the point guard’s third consecutive double - digit scoring night, as he continues to receive a considerable allotment of playing time even when Jrue Holiday is active due to the latter’s minutes cap.

Where New Orleans' lack of playoff experience was on display in Game 3 as it squandered a 20 - point fourth quarter lead, Golden State showed resolve by holding onto its sizeable fourth quarter lead in Game 4 on Saturday to close out the series. The Pelicans were able to cut the Warriors' lead to seven with just under two minutes remaining, but the Warriors had an answer every time down the floor. Stephen Curry led the charge for the Warriors, scoring 13 of his 39 points in the fourth quarter to complete the sweep. Golden State finished its first series sweep for the first time since winning the championship in 1975 with Saturday's win. Golden State has punched its ticket for the second round of the playoff and now awaits the results of another Western Conference series. Outside of Curry's big performance, the Warriors benefited from solid efforts by Klay Thompson and Draymond Green. Thompson finished with 25 points and shot over 50 percent from the floor while Green barely missed out on a triple - double with 22 points, 10 rebounds, and eight assists. Andrew Bogut's early foul trouble forced coach Steve Kerr to adjust his lineup, but the Warriors still managed to out - rebound the Pelicans despite not having Bogut at their disposal for much of the game.

The Pelicans have reasons to be optimistic for next season as Anthony Davis is entering his prime and is one of the league's best players already.

The Celtics built a strong lead early in this game, out - scoring the Mavericks 31 - 16 in the first quarter alone. With an eight - point lead heading into the fourth quarter, the Celtics had a chance to close it out, but the Mavericks took off on a 36 - 24 run in the end to secure the four - point victory on the road in Boston. The Mavericks were the superior shooters in this game, finishing at 51 percent from the field and 35 percent from the three - point line, while the Celtics went 41 percent from the field and just 31 percent from deep. Behind a strong performance from Dirk Nowitzki, the Mavericks won their fifth straight game, which gives them the third best record in the stacked Western Conference. Nowitzki finished with a game - high of 23 points (9 - 14 FG, 1 - 2 3Pt, 4 - 4 FT), 14 of which came in the first half, while also adding seven rebounds over 34 minutes. The 37 - year - old German has combined for 44 points and 13 rebounds over the last two games and is a big reason for the Mavericks continued success this season. Wes Matthews had one of his better scoring performances of the year. He posted 18 points and three assists over 33 minutes, despite shooting just 33 percent from the field. Matthews has really struggled with his shot of late, combining to shoot a dreadful 8 - of - 33 from the floor over his last three games. Matthews is a career 44 percent shooter from the field, though, so expect his numbers to increase moving forward. Zaza Pachulia chipped in with a 14 - point, 12 - rebound double - double as well. Despite coming off the bench for his third straight game following a minor calf injury, Avery Bradley still was able to have some decent production. In 31 minutes, he did a little bit of everything, recording 18 points (7 - 17 FG, 3 - 7 3Pt, 1 - 2 FT), six rebounds, three assists and four steals before fouling out late. The rebounds and steals were both season - highs for the guard, who could move back into the starting lineup as early as Friday. Starting in his place, Isaiah Thomas had a solid all - around showing. He finished with a team - high of 19 points (7 - 16 FG, 1 - 8 3Pt, 4 - 6 FT), to go along with six assists and three steals. Thomas had scored 20 points or more over the Cetlics' last three games, all of which resulted in wins, but his production Wednesday was n't enough to keep the streak going. Jared Sullinger added a double - double with 18 points (7 - 19 FG, 1 - 3 3Pt, 3 - 4 FT) and 12 rebounds over 30 minutes.

Stephen Curry was upgraded to questionable heading into Game 4, and by game time, he was listed as the starting point guard. While it looked like the recently named MVP for a second consecutive year was a bit rusty, fast forward to the fourth quarter and overtime and Curry quickly reminded the world how terrifyingly dominant he could be. Curry stormed out to score the Warriors first 12 points in OT, and closed the door for the Warriors, on the road, on their way to a commanding series lead. The game featured a handful of lead changes in the fourth quarter, but up until that point, the Blazers set the pace and made Golden State play their game. Damian LIllard and C.J. McCollum were terrific in the backcourt, and kept staving off the Warriors constant knack at ripping off low double figure runs. Everything seemed to be going in the Blazers favor in the first half, especially after Shaun Livingston was ejected from the game after back - to - back technical fouls for arguing with the ref. The second half saw Draymond Green step up immensely on the defensive end, and once Curry got cooking, their was no looking back. Curry finished with 40 points, eight rebounds and nine assists on 16 - of - 32 shooting, and was held without a three - pointer on his first nine attempts. He did manage to flip the script on that front by burying 5 - of - 16 by the conclusion of the game. Green managed to once again round out the box score with an impressive 21 points, nine rebounds, five assists, four steals and seven blocks, while Klay Thompson added 23 points on 5 - of - 10 shooting from deep. LIllard contributed 36 points, six rebounds and 10 assists, while McCollum poured in 24 points, three boards and two assists. The Blazers point guard ignited Moda Center in the fourth quarter and kept the fans on their feet as they carried momentum to the overtime period.

Brooklyn has kept their competitive spirit thriving despite the disappointing season, and has often played as if they\\'re capable of beating virtually any team in the NBA on the right night. The Pistons (34 - 37) were the latest unit to learn that lesson the hard way, as they first saw the Nets storm back from a 31 - 22 first - quarter deficit to forge a six - point halftime lead by outscoring Detroit, 28 - 13, in the second quarter. They added to that advantage in the third before the Pistons staged a rally of their own in the fourth, coming back from a 94 - 87 deficit with 1:52 to play to tie the game at both 94 and 96 in the closing seconds. Taking the ball for a final possession with two seconds remaining, the Nets saw Brook Lopez drain a jumper off a Randy Foye assist as time expired for the win.

Spencer Dinwiddie drew the start for Jeremy Lin (ankle) and filled out the stat sheet with 10 points, eight rebounds, four assists and two blocks.

With Davis then missing from the line - up and Omer Asik still out, the Pelicans had to look down their bench, while sharpshooter Ryan Anderson filled in as starter. Despite missing their all - star, the Pelicans held the lead for most of the game but the tides turned as the Timberwolves took the lead with 2:40 left, 104 - 103. Once the Timberwolves got on top, they hung on to steal the win in New Orleans, behind Karl-Anthony Towns\\' team - high 30 points. The youngsters had huge games for Minnesota. Karl-Anthony Towns was a beast as he tallied a team - high 30 points (13 - 20 FG, 0 - 1 3Pt, 4 - 8 FT), along with 15 rebounds, four assists, two steals and one block, in 35 minutes.

Andrew Wiggins struggled from the field but made up for it from the free throw line, as he added 20 points (5 - 15 FG, 0 - 3 3Pt, 10 - 10 FT), including two clutch free throws with three seconds left that ultimately won the game. The Timberwolves shot 50 percent from the field and only attempted 15 three - points, of which five were successful. New Orleans came into this game winners of five of their last seven and with the good news that Eric Gordon would be returning to the line - up after missing 16 games, but things took a turn for the worst when Anthony Davis injured his foot in pre - game warm up.

Jrue Holiday added 20 points (8 - 13 FG, 1 - 3 3Pt, 3 - 3 FT) and eight assists, in 35 minutes off the bench.

During the first half, Knicks legend Charles Oakley was escorted out by security and later arrested by New York City police after a confrontation with franchise owner James Dolan. Oakley had been in attendance of the game. The Knicks quickly issued a PR statement condemning Oakley\\'s behavior and stating that the organization \"hopes he will get help soon.\" The incident did not detract from the competitiveness of the basketball game, however, as the Clippers (32 - 21) narrowly escaped with the win. Superstar point guard Chris Paul (thumb) remained out, and point guard Austin Rivers struggled in his place. Rivers shot just 3 - of - 10 with five turnovers. Offense was still fairly easy to come by for the Clippers, though, as center DeAndre Jordan recorded a career - high 28 points on 11 - of - 13 shooting while All-Star forward Blake Griffin scored another 32. Los Angeles entered the fourth quarter trailing by seven but went on an offensive tear to finish the game, establishing a lead in the final minutes. The Knicks (22 - 32), meanwhile, have had the league\\'s second - worst record since the start of the new year. Though four starters scored at least 18 points, bench production was nowhere to be found for the struggling Knicks. No member of New York\\'s second unit scored more than five points, and the bench combined to shoot just 6 - of - 20 from the field.

In Portland, the fourth quarter has aptly been named “Lillard Time” and the nickname is fitting for the point guard who posted 41 points. While the ball normally finds Lillard’s hands when the game is on the line, it was C.J. McCollum who hit the clutch mid range jumper with 5 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter to tie the game, which led to an extra five minutes of play. John Wall had an open opportunity to win the game at the buzzer, but the shot bounced off the front of the rim, granted, Wall was essential in putting the Blazers on their heels late in the game. The two all - star point guards traded baskets in the overtime period, as Lillard hit a three pointer to go ahead by five points, but one possession later, Wall buried a three of his own to bring the game back within striking distance. Two and half minutes of missed opportunities from both teams dragged by until Lillard drove the lane and finished at the rim to put Portland up by four points with 24 seconds left, and they did not look back after that. The Wizards did a terrific job keeping Lillard off the ball during the fourth quarter, but overtime proved too much to handle. Alongside Lillard’s 41 points, he added 11 assists, five rebounds and one steal on 12 - of - 25 shooting. C.J. McCollum scored 18 points, but struggled with possession and turned the ball over six times in the rare outing for the shooting guard. The Portland Bench bailed out the rest of the starters, who combined for a lowly 14 points, as Meyers Leonard led the way 10 points, six rebounds and three assists. He earned some quality minutes in the fourth quarter and overtime, as coach Terry Stotts seemed to be a lot of trust in him down the stretch. John Wall and Marcin Gortat led the Wizards, and although Wall’s shooting rhythm took a while to get going, he played tremendous defense late in the game and kept his team in the game. Wall finished with 20 points, 11 assists and five rebounds on 8 - of - 25 shooting, including three buckets from behind the arc. Gortat added 19 points and 10 rebounds to complete the double - double, while Ramon Sessions put on a shooting clinic off the bench after scoring 21 points on 9 - of - 12 from the field.

The start came as no surprise, seeing that Cousins participated in the team\\'s shootaround earlier on Wednesday. The hottest shooting big man throughout the month of January has continued his hot streak into February and finished with 30 points, 11 rebounds and four assists, but committed six costly turnovers, including a lane violation while on the free throw line in the waning seconds of the fourth quarter. Darren Collison and Marco Belinelli pitched in 18 points and 19 points, respectively, to aid Cousins in the effort, but it was not enough to earn the home win. The game was kept close throughout its entirety, but the final minute came to a crawling finish, with multiple missed free throws and turnovers, eventually leaning in the Bulls favor. Chicago was without their superstar as well, as Jimmy Butler (ankle) was sidelined with knee soreness. Unlike Cousins, this news came as a surprise considering Butler was not listed on the injury report heading into Wednesday. Butler did come off a 47 minute performance on Monday, so it is possible that it was a strategic rest on the Bulls part.

DeMarcus Cousins is always the centerpiece of the Sacramento offense due to his immense talent. However, any time that a fellow member of the starting five goes down, the mercurial big man's importance and usage rate both tend to go through the roof. Such has been the case in the wake of the loss of Rudy Gay for the season to an Achilles injury, and the most recent example came Saturday as the Kings (19 - 28) handed the Hornets (23 - 25) their fourth straight loss. Cousins led the way with a massive 35 - point, 18 - rebound double - double and made two pivotal plays in the closing seconds. He netted a driving layup with 14 seconds left to give the Kings the lead, and then drained a free throw for the final margin of victory. Cousins added four assists and a block to his aforementioned numbers. Darren Collison was a distant second with 17 points, two assists and a block. Anthony Tolliver posted a bench - leading 14 points that he supplemented with seven boards, three assists, two steals and a block.

Washington found out before the game that starting shooting guard Bradley Beal will miss a minimum of two weeks with what is being termed as an initial - stage stress reaction in his lower right fibula. The development thrust Garrett Temple into the starting lineup in Beal\\'s stead, a situation that the six - year pro had played well in earlier this season. It also figured to add more offensive responsibility to Beal\\'s backcourt mate John Wall and small forward Otto Porter, Jr. Both responded in fine fashion Saturday, with Wall posting his fourth consecutive 26 - point outing and adding a season - high 16 assists. It was the All-Star point guard\\'s third consecutive double - double, and he also drained two key free throws in the closing seconds to extend a razor - thin 112 - 111 lead to the final margin of victory. Meanwhile, Porter managed a career - high 28 points and four three - pointers, also a high - water mark. The visitors also benefited from Marcin Gortat\\'s fifth double - double in six games, with the nine - year pro tallying 14 points and 12 rebounds. Jared Dudley also pitched in with 13 points, and Ramon Sessions paced the Washington bench with 17 points and six assists. Overall, the Wizards outplayed the normally fast - paced Mavericks at their own game, amassing 31 fast - break points to Dallas\\' 14. Washington improved to 11 - 12 but remains in last place in the Eastern Conference\\'s Southeast Division. They head to Memphis to take on the Grizzlies on Monday. The Mavericks received another outstanding effort from the resurgent Wesley Matthews, who continues to round back into form after the Achilles surgery that cut short his 2014 - 15 campaign in Portland. Matthews poured in 28 points and was 6 - for - 11 from beyond the arc, his second - best total from long range this season. J.J. Barea was actually the second - highest scorer for Dallas and accomplished it in a reserve role, amassing 21 points over 29 minutes in his second game back after an ankle injury. Zaza Pachulia and Raymond Felton posted a double - double and triple - double, respectively, with the former collecting 10 points and 12 rebounds and the latter tallying 10 points, 11 rebounds and 11 assists. Dirk Nowitzki pitched in with 13 points, six rebounds and a pair of assists.

After taking a big lead into halftime and then letting the Hornets make a comeback leading to this overtime thriller, the Bucks were able to save themselves in the extra period and out - scored the Hornets 21 - 11 to seal the victory on the road. The Bucks as a whole shot much better than the Hornets, going 47 percent from the field, while New Orleans went just 37 percent from the floor. This win puts the Bucks winning percentage back at .500 on the season. The Bucks had six players reach double figures, with three of them coming off the bench. Brandon Knight led all scorers for the Bucks, finishing with 18 points (8 - 19 FG, 2 - 5 3Pt) and four assists. Despite a solid showing offensively, he did record a season - high of eight turnovers, so it was n\\'t all good for the guard. Giannis Antetokounmpo was the other big contributor in the starting lineup. He was very efficient in this game, going 7 - for - 8 from the field and 2 - for - 3 from the free throw line to finish with 16 points, while also adding eight rebounds. He\\'s struggled over the Bucks\\' last two games, combining for only 12 points, so it was good to see him get back on track. The biggest bench contributor was Jared Dudley, who came one rebound shy of a double - double. He posted 17 points (5 - 10 FG, 2 - 4 3Pt, 5 - 5 FT) and nine rebounds in the victory. Most of the production for the Hornets came from the duo of Gerald Henderson and Kemba Walker. Walker had a game - high of 28 points (7 - 22 FG, 2 - 8 3Pt), while adding an uncharacteristic four blocked shots. A huge portion of his points came from the free throw line, where he made 12 - of - 13 attempts. Henderson on the other hand shot well, going 7 - for - 13 from the field and 1 - for - 3 from beyond the arc to score 19 points. He\\'s combined for only nine points over the last two games, so this marked a bounce back game for the shooting guard. The only other Hornet to reach double figures in points was Michael Kidd-Gilchrist who finished with 10 points (5 - 10 FG). With Al Jefferson having a tough night from the field (3 - 12 FG) and leaving the game in the fourth quarter with a groin strain, it figured to limit the Hornets overall success.

They say that familiarity breeds contempt, and though these two teams had n\\'t met this season until Monday, two games in a span of four days caused things to get chippy Thursday at the Time Warner Cable Arena in Charlotte. The game was physical throughout, most notably when John Wall knocked Brian Roberts to the floor on a hard screen in the first half. Tensions boiled over in the fourth when Cody Zeller and Nene Hilario got tangled up, drawing a double technical. The Wizards recent free fall continued and to make things worse, Bradley Beal left the game after 11 minutes with a toe injury. Washington has now dropped five in a row, including two this week to Charlotte. The Wizards got another great showing from John Wall, who finished with 15 points and 13 rebounds while Paul Pierce led the team in scoring with 19 points. Washington\\'s losing streak has caused it to lose ground in the East and is at risk of being tied by Cleveland depending on how the Cavaliers\\' game ends later Thursday evening. The Wizards will look to snap their losing streak Saturday when they host the Nets. Charlotte is quietly one of the hottest teams in the East right now, having won three in a row and seven of its last ten. Brian Roberts was able to return to the game after being shaken up on the aforementioned pick by Wall and finished with 12 points. Even in Bismack Biyombo\\'s absence, the Hornets were able to out - rebound the Wizards 50 - 37. The Hornets will return to action Saturday in Philadelphia.

Thaddeus Young has always been a reliable, albeit unspectacular performer who nevertheless turns in a solid effort virtually every time he is on the floor. The veteran forward, along with center Brook Lopez, put the Nets’ offense on his back Saturday in a valiant effort that fell just short of netting Brooklyn their first win of the season. Young posted his second double - double in the last three games, tallying 18 points, 13 rebounds, and two steals. Lopez has been the heart and soul of a Nets offense that was ranked 29th in points scored coming into Saturday’s contest. The 27 - year - old posted his third consecutive game with at least 20 points, although he played under 30 minutes for the first time since last Saturday versus Memphis. Besides Young and Lopez, the rest of the Nets starters were unable to provide much in the way of offensive support, with only Jarrett Jack (10 points) scoring in double figures. Richard Hollis-Jefferson could only muster two points in his second career start, while Joe Johnson continued his season - long struggles with only eight points on 3 - for - 10 shooting from the field. The Nets dropped to 0 - 7 and remain in last place in the Eastern Conference’s Atlantic Division. Brooklyn gets a three - day break before a date with the Rockets in Houston on Wednesday. The Bucks enjoyed another strong effort from new center Greg Monroe, who rebounded from an eight - point outing versus the Knicks on Friday to tally 20 points, eight rebounds, two assists, two steals, and two blocks. Tyler Ennis was serviceable in starting for Michael Carter-Williams (ankle), amassing nine points, a rebound, an assist, and a steal in an efficient 16 minutes. Jerryd Bayless, who had started Wednesday for Carter-Williams, finished with the bulk of the playing time at point guard, totaling 32 minutes on the floor and producing 19 points to pace Milwaukee’s bench. Khris Middleton (14 points) and Giannis Antetokounmpo (11 points) chipped in nice complementary performances in the victory.

Though the Wizards rank as the league\\'s second - worst three - point shooting team, the deep ball played a major part in their approach on Friday. The team shot 13 - of - 31 from beyond the arc. It was truly an all - encompassing victory, however, as defense and tenacity on the glass played an equally major role in earning the win. Washington held a 52 - 41 advantage on the glass and recorded 12 steals along with 10 blocked shots. Atlanta was forced into a ridiculous 19 turnovers on the night. The Hawks (27 - 20) seemed to be in good shape heading into Friday but received a complete beat - down. The loss comes at an inopportune time for Atlanta, who had been just one game back from second place in the Eastern Conference prior to Friday\\'s loss. The team suffered one of its worst defeats of the season in the matchup, shooting just 36 percent and under 30 percent from beyond the arc. In particular, recently - named All-Star Paul Millsap struggled, shooting just 1 - of - 7 for four points with four rebounds. Atlanta will host the Knicks on Sunday, while the Wizards will visit New Orleans. Table format: There are two tables.  The first table has 5 columns and 2 rows.

The Grizzlies badly needed a slump buster, as they had lost three straight in a tough stretch of their schedule against the Cavaliers, Warriors and Spurs coming into Monday. That\\'s just what they got in the form of the DeMarcus Cousin-less Sacramento Kings. Marc Gasol did n\\'t have a field day scoring the ball as Reggie Evans, who stepped in for Cousins, is a bothersome defender. Instead Gasol was able to find passing lanes that led to baskets as he finished with six assists, leading his team in that category from the center position. Memphis is elated that March is over, as they piled up eight losses, making it their worst month of the season. Former Memphis star Rudy Gay did his best to pick up the slack for Cousins. Gay put up 24 points in 29 minutes but left the game in the third quarter after being elbowed by Gasol. He did n\\'t return as he was suffering from concussion like symptoms. The Kings went into the final period down 11 and with their go - to scorer. They were unable to muster enough points to surpass the Grizzlies and garnered their second straight loss after a four - game win streak.

Reggie Jackson and Serge Ibaka did everything they could, with Jackson scoring 29 points (12 - 21 FG, 2 - 6 3Pt, 3 - 3 FT), to go along with four rebounds, four assists, two steals and one block, and Ibaka posting 14 points (4 - 13 FG, 2 - 5 3Pt, 4 - 4 FT), with seven rebounds, two assists and one block. In the end though, the Bucks just had more bench proudction which allowed the Bucks to stop the Thunder from stealing a road win. Oklahoma City now heads to Boston to take on the Celtics on Wednesday. The Bucks may have only had one player score in double figures from their starting lineup in Brandon Knight, who scored 16 points (6 - 15 FG, 1 - 5 3Pt, 3 - 5 FT), with four assists, four rebounds and one steal, but the bench picked up the slack.

The Heat looked down and out early in this game but showed some major fight to come back and win. What is most impressive is that this was the second half of a back - to - back set and it was on the road. This was one of the first times that Dwyane Wade, Chris Bosh and Goran Dragic all played well in the same game and that\\'s a scary sight for other Eastern Conference teams. All three players scored at least 22 points and combined for 68 all together. Miami\\'s next game will be a favorable one, as they host the Brooklyn nets on Monday. The Magic fell apart here in the second half and showed their lack of maturity. They actually shot an outstanding 54 percent from the field against an elite Miami defense, but played bad defense themselves in the second half. Nikola Vucevic had one of his best all - around games of the season, as he collected 22 points, 10 rebounds and six assists in the defeat. All five starters actually scored in double - figures and the bench was a letdown all evening long. Orlando will look to play better in their next game against the New Orleans Pelicans on Monday.

The Nets were able to out - rebound the Magic 45 to 31, with Mason Plumlee leading the way as he recorded a team - leading 10. This win marks the second consecutive victory for Brooklyn as they now sit one game out of first place behind the Toronto Raptors, who they\\'ll play Wednesday in an attempt to take a share of the lead in the Atlantic Division.

The Lakers injury problems suffered a few more setbacks before the game wrapped up, as Kobe Bryant (achilles) left midway through the game to nurse his nagging achilles and rookie Larry Nance Jr. left with knee soreness after just three minutes of playing time. The beat up Lakers squad is far from an excuse for their play halfway through the season and the offensive miscues only add to their troubled year. Developing the young talent combination of Jordan Clarkson, Julius Randle and D’Angelo Russell does not seem to be the number one priority with the Kobe Bryant retirement tour in full swing, and the wasted experience will take its toll. Los Angeles turned to Lou Williams to score in volume, but managed 20 points on 15 shots and fell short of what was needed for his team to keep the game within reach at any point. Jordan Clarkson and D’Angelo Russell joined Williams in scoring double figures. The Lakers will look to get their 10th when they host the Houston Rockets (21 - 20) on Sunday. Utah has been experiencing a fair share of injury troubles as well, with both Trevor Booker (concussion) and Derrick Favors (back), sidelined on Saturday. Favors missed his 13th consecutive game, and it is still unclear if their is another issue or if the Jazz are taking his return slowly. Rudy Gobert led the way with a monstrous performance, scoring 18 points, grabbing 18 rebounds and blocking five shots in 30 minutes. Gordon Hayward contributed 14 points, five rebounds and five assists, while four additional Jazz players finished in double figures (Trey Lyles, Rodney Hood, Trey Burke and Joe Ingles) in a strong team effort. Utah shot 49 percent from the floor and kept the game out of reach from the Lakers from the 2nd quarter on. Utah continues to battle for the 8 - seed in the Western Conference, and will look to pick up another win when they visit the Charlotte Hornets (18 - 22) on Monday.

Reigning MVP Steph Curry also impressed, scoring 24 points to go with eight assists and three steals. The Warriors were able to pull away in the third quarter, going on a scoring tear while Russell Westbrook sat on the bench. The team shot almost 55 percent and dished out a whopping 35 assists on the night. The Thunder (25 - 19) saw strong play from a handful of players but could not get the job done as a team. In what has almost become a normal night for the superstar, Russell Westbrook posted a massive triple - double. Westbrook scored 27 points to go with 15 rebounds and 13 assists. However, the elite point guard did commit 10 turnovers on the night. Sixth man Enes Kanter delivered 22 points and nine rebounds off the bench.

This was the good old Memphis defense of the past, as they held the Rockets to under 38 percent shooting and won the turnover battle 23 - 11.

If it weren’t for a prayer from Corey Brewer in their last game, the Rockets would have lost their sixth - straight game tonight. There\\'s a lot of holes on this team right now, as they are shooting poorly, playing bad defense and now playing team - ball. The team was led by James Harden, who tallied 22 points, six rebounds and five assists in the loss. Dwight Howard had another solid game as well, as he totaled 12 points and 15 boards in the defeat. The firing of coach Kevin McHale was a questionable decision and games like this make it look even more questionable. Houston will look to play better against the New York Knicks on Saturday, as both teams are playing the second half of a back - to - back set. This was definitely the Grizzlies best performance of the season, as they got it done on both ends. Not only did they play good offense, they stifled a potent Rockets offense. Memphis were led by a career - performance from Marc Gasol, who tallied 16 points, 11 rebounds, 11 assists and four steals in a spectacular game. Mike Conley was also very good, as he collected 26 points, five assists, three rebounds and three steals in the win.

The Pelicans led 102 - 88 with two minutes left and barely held on for a much needed win. The key for New Orleans was the rebounding, as they brought down 54 boards to the Clippers 35. That marks the 10tth - straight game that the Clippers have been outrebounded, with nine of those being by at least 12 boards. The Pelicans shot 49 percent from the field, while holding Los Angeles to just 40 percent in their victory. The Clippers continue to struggle and the return of Blake Griffin is becoming more envious every day. This marks their fourth loss in their last five games and their sixth loss in their last eight. Chris Paul had yet another superb outing though, as he tallied 24 points, 13 assists, six rebounds and four assists. J.J. Redick scored 24 of his own on 9 - for - 11 shooting. Up next for the Clippers is a rivalry match against the Golden State Warriors on Wednesday, so the tough times look likely to continue. New Orleans has had to play many games without Anthony Davis, but this may have been their best performance. They also played without Ryan Anderson and Tyreke Evans, so it was a true team effort. All five starters scored at least 14 points, with Jrue Holiday leading the team while also contributing eight assists. Omer Asik got the start and double - doubled, in a 15 - point, 14 - rebound effort. Toney Douglas flirted with a triple - double as well, as he accumulated 15 points, seven rebounds and nine assists.

In a battle of a dominant defense versus a potent offense, the better offense prevailed. The Kings were at full force tonight, as they shot an amazing 56 percent from the field in their victory. The Jazz continue to play poor defense without Rudy Gobert and that can be exemplified by the fact that they failed to record a block in this game. The Jazz have been the better team this season, but the Kings simply have more talent and that proved to be the difference on Tuesday. Utah is known for their stifling defense, but it simply hasn’t been the same with Gobert. They are now allowing nearly 115 points a game without Gobert in the lineup and they simply ca n\\'t score enough to win those types of games. Utah actually got off 15 more shots than the Kings, but were outshot by 15 percent. Utah\\'s best player on this night was Gordon Hayward yet again, as he tallied 18 points, eight rebounds and six assists in the defeat. The bench also played well, as Trevor Booker, Trey Burke and Alec Burks combined for 42 points. Utah\\'s going to have to learn to play better defense without Gobert or the recent struggles will continue. Utah will host the New York Knicks on Wednesday in their next scheduled game. This win ended a three - game skid for the Kings and it came with a great team performance. The starters were simply fantastic, as they combined for 92 points in the win. Rudy Gay and DeMarcus Cousins both led the team with 23 points and Omri Casspi and Rajon Rondo pitched in with some nice double - doubles.

The veteran trio of James Harden, Patrick Beverley and Dwight Howard stepped up when it mattered most, tallying 61 of the Rockets\\' 116 points on the night.

Wiggins managed 32 points by draining 11 of his 20 shot attempts, and added season - high totals of 10 rebounds and six assists. He also sank two late free throws with one second left to seal the hard - fought victory.

However, when quality opponents come calling, the void felt by the absence of a player of Lowry\\'s caliber eventually rears its ugly head. Such was the case Wednesday, as the Wizards (36 - 23) leveraged superb efforts from trade - deadline acquisition Bojan Bogdanovic and trusted shooting guard Bradley Beal to pull out the tough road win.

Tuesday\\'s matchup offered a clash of two of the league\\'s brightest young teams. The end result was a thriller, as Minnesota (17 - 28) managed to come away with the win following a contested buzzer - beater from small forward Andrew Wiggins. Wiggins finished the night as the game\\'s leading scorer with 31 points and came up clutch on the defensive end with two steals. Reigning Rookie of the Year and star Karl-Anthony Towns also played a big part in the Wolves\\' win, as he came away with 18 points and 10 rebounds on the night. While Minnesota made plenty of mistakes, including sending Phoenix to the free - throw line 32 times, the Wolves were ultimately able to capitalize on their 52 percent shooting from the field to earn the victory. Phoenix (15 - 30), meanwhile, sits near the bottom of the league but had won two straight before hosting Minny on Tuesday. A big piece of the Suns\\' recent success has been another sophomore phenom, Devin Booker. Booker scored 26 against the Timberwolves to lead the team and extend his 20 - point game streak to ten. The Suns also saw perhaps the biggest game of the season for aging veteran Tyson Chandler. The center had 22 points on 9 - of - 9 shooting and pulled down 17 rebounds.

The Hawks already had a double - digit lead after one quarter, and gradually pulled away from an overmatched Sixers squad that was coming off three full days of rest following a near upset of the reigning NBA champion Warriors last Saturday. Atlanta shot 52 percent from the field and 50 percent from beyond the arc, and with a comfortable lead throughout the second half, was able to give their bench players extended playing time. The reserves maximized the extra opportunity, scoring a whopping 80 of the team\\'s 124 total points on the night. Five members of the second unit tallied double - digit scoring, and the Hawks enjoyed a lead as large as 43 points at one point in the fourth quarter. Atlanta was led by a pair of 13 - point efforts from Tim Hardaway, Jr. and Mike Scott. Hardway added seven rebounds, four assists and a steal, while Scott contributed a near double - double, hauling in nine boards, dishing out an assist and recording a steal. Three additional reserves - - Dennis Schroder, Thabo Sefolosha and Mike Muscala - - pitched in with 12 points apiece. Among the starters, Kent Bazemore led the way with his own 12 - point tally, which he complemented with three rebounds, two assists, a steal and a block. Paul Millsap and Jeff Teague followed with matching 10 - point performances, with the former also registering four rebounds, three assists, a steal and two blocks, and the latter amassing three rebounds, three assists and three steals.

Okafor also had three assists, a steal and a block, but turned the ball over five times as well. Noel dished out five assists of his own, along with two steals and a block.

The 76ers gave the Mavericks a bit of a scare, but ultimately were unable to capture their first win of the season. Dirk Nowitzki scored 12 of his 21 points in the fourth quarter, hitting a handful of clutch free throws along with Deron Williams to ice the game. Philadelphia had the advantage on the glass, outrebounding the Mavericks 46 - 39, but too many turnovers led to the 76ers demise. Chandler Parsons has been working his way back from a surgically - repaired knee, but has seen his minutes slowly increase. He scored a season - high 20 points in a season - high 21 minutes and took over the game early in the first half. Dallas really needs Parsons to get things going and this was certainly a step in the right direction. The Mavericks struggled from the field, shooting a lowly 40 percent, with Nowitzki, Williams and Wesley Matthews all having off nights shooting the basketball. Regardless, the win propelled Dallas into third place in the Western Conference. It\\'s beginning to look like the season is lost for the 76ers, but they still have Jahlil Okafor to look forward to, as he continued his trek towards Rookie of the Year. The former Duke Blue Devil turned in his second straight double - double, scoring 19 points and pulling down 11 rebounds over 33 minutes. But perhaps the most surprising player for Philly has been point guard T.J. McConnell, who keeps filling up the score sheet night in and night out.

The Blazers had a strong sencond quarter both offensively and defensively. They were able to hold the Timberwolves to only 14 points, while also scoring 26 of their own. The Blazers were able to take a 54 - 43 rebounding advantage, which may have also given them exactly what they needed to pull out the victory at home Monday. LaMarcus Aldridge and Wes Matthews did most of the damage to the Timberwolves in this game. Aldridge went an efficient 11 - for - 17 from the floor to score 26 points, while also grabbing 15 rebounds. He\\'s now recorded four double - doubles in the past five games, increasing his season total to seven. Matthews on the other hand shot 8 - for - 13 from the field and 6 - for - 10 from beyond the arc to score 23 points combined with six rebounds. He\\'s now averaging 26 points in his last three games, as he\\'s been on fire of late. Damian Lillard struggled from deep in this one. He was only able to hit 1 - of - 7 three - pointers, but still contributed 17 points and eight assists in 36 minutes. He\\'s averaging 20 points and 7 assists on the season. Nicolas Batum was the only other Blazer to reach double - digit points with 10. Despite being questionable with an illness coming into Sunday\\'s game, Andrew Wiggins made the start and tried to play through it. He only ended up recording 18 minutes though, while finishing with seven points. Most of the Timberwolves production came from Shabazz Muhammad and Maurice Williams. Muhammad had arguably his best game of the season. He shot 12 - for - 17 from the field and 4 - for - 8 from the free throw line to score a season - high 28 points. He has n\\'t reached the 20 - point mark yet this season, so it was a surprise performance for the forward who benefitted from the extra time he was given. Williams also had a big game and finished with 21 points and 11 assists. It was his third double - double in a row and fourth in five games.

The Spurs led by 10 at the half and extended that lead to 23 headed into the fourth quarter. Defense was key for San Antonio, as they held New Orleans to 37 percent from the field and 17 percent from three - point range. The Pelicans were held to just 34 points in the second half, as they had to play this game in the back end of a back - to - back set.

Patty Mills started for Tony Parker and finished second on the team with 18 points and five assists.

The Celtics had a comeback win over the Philadelphia 76ers in their last game in which they finished the game on a 16 - 4 run. The Wizards on the other hand, scored six points in the fourth quarter to blow a double - digit lead against the Charlotte Hornets in the fourth quarter of their last game. Clearly that epic collapse carried over here for the Wizards and they ca n\\'t allow that to hang over them too much longer. Boston outshot, outrebounded, outassisted, and committed less turnovers than the Wizards in the blowout. They also beat them in every quarter by at least five points and this was the definition of a start - to - finish blowout. The Wizards shot just 32 percent in this loss and it was a downright ugly performance. The most worrisome part is the lack of hustle this team showed, as they were nearly doubled in the steals and blocks categories. John Wall had another bad game with just 10 points, six assists and four rebounds. He\\'s been in a rut as of late and they need him to play like a star if the team is to get out of this slump. The only Washington player who showed up was Jared Dudley, who dropped 19 points off the bench. The Wizards will try to get back on track on Saturday against the Toronto Raptors. This was one of Boston\\'s best games of the season, as they handled an Eastern Conference foe extremely easily. The Celtics were clicking on all cylinders, but their defense was the key, as they held the Wizards to 32 percent shooting.

However, they looked strong in this one, jumping out to a 32 - 12 first quarter lead. Milwaukee fought back in the second and third quarters in order to close the gap to five, heading into the fourth.

The Cavs entered the night trying to not only end a rare three - game losing streak, but also get back on track at home after dropping their first game in Quicken Loans Arena last Thursday versus the Wizards. Things were n't exactly looking up for the home team at the half, as Cleveland faced a 56 - 47 deficit by intermission. A resurgent and resolute Cavs squad took the floor in the third quarter however, handily outscoring the visitors 30 - 19 during the period on the back of Kevin Love's nine points. Then it was LeBron James' turn in the fourth quarter, during which he tallied 12 of his 33 points on the night to help Cleveland escape with the victory. Portland received typically outstanding performances from their dynamic backcourt duo of Damian Lillard (33 points, six rebounds, six assists) and C.J. McCollum (24 points, five assists, three rebounds and a pair of steals). However, it was the insufficient production from their other three starters that played a crucial part in Portland coming up just short of handing Cleveland a second straight home loss. Mason Plumlee, slumping as of late, contributed a modest 10 points, four rebounds, four assists and a block against the Cavs' top - five ranked defense versus centers. Al-Farouq Aminu had one of his worst games since donning a Blazers uniform this offseason, tallying only four points, five rebounds and a block. Meanwhile, Noah Vonleh contributed next to nothing in a start at power forward, only pitching in two points and four rebounds. Allen Crabbe continued his string of solid performances from the bench, posting a fifth consecutive double - digit scoring effort to pace the Portland reserves. The third - year pro managed 14 points, three rebounds and an assist. The Trail Blazers fell to 9 - 14 and currently reside in fourth place in the Western Conference's Northwest Division. They now head to Phoenix for a Friday matchup versus the Suns. James complemented his game - high 33 points with 10 rebounds, three assists, two steals and three blocks. The perennial All-Star looked refreshed after being held out of the Cavs' most recent contest, a road tilt versus the Heat last Saturday. Love's aforementioned third - period tally of nine points represented half of his scoring on the night, as he totaled 18 points, along with four rebounds, four assists and four steals. Matthew Delladedova received another start in place of Mo Williams, and responded with a strong 17 - point effort. Williams was active as well, and paced the Cleveland bench with 13 points, a pair of rebounds and a pair of assists over a highly efficient 21 minutes.

The emerging dynamic duo of Damian Lillard and C.J. McCollum helped pave the way for Portland\\'s high - octane offensive outing, combining for 64 points, including 39 for Lillard. The pair helped facilitate a perimeter attack for the Blazers, as they contributed six of the team\\'s 13 three - point makes.

Utah, meanwhile, is struggling to remain healthy despite the season having barely begun.

Utah\\'s offense was able to fill the void, however, with significant contributions coming from newly - acquired veteran Joe Johnson (29 points, 12 - 16 shooting) and sophomore Rodney Hood (26 points, two steals).

Despite shooting worse from the free - throw line, the aggressiveness of Cleveland to get there was the difference, as they attempted 43 free - throws to the Nets 19. The turnovers were decisive as well, with the Cavaliers winning that battle, 19 - 12. Much of that is attributed to the fact that Cleveland recorded 14 steals in the win.

The Knicks made a run in the third quarter, but could n't continue it in the fourth, as the Celtics stole the 11 - point victory on the road. The Celtics were the better shooters in this game, going 55 percent from the field, while the Knicks shot just 49 percent. The Celtics also out - rebounded the Knicks 39 - 35, even furthering their advantage Tuesday. Already the two scoring leaders for the Celtics this season, both Jared Sullinger and Avery Bradley did the most damage in this game. Bradley went an impressive 11 - for - 14 from the field and 3 - for - 5 from the three - point line to score a game - high of 26 points, while also adding four assists. He's had a decent two - game stretch, combining for 43 points, six assists and three steals. Sullinger on the other hand nearly double - doubled, recording 22 points (11 - 19 FG, 0 - 3 3Pt), nine rebounds and six assists. He had a poor showing in Sunday's game against the Heat, so it was good to see him get back on track Tuesday. Replacing Tyler Zeller as the starting center, Brandon Bass finished with 12 points and four rebounds in 30 minutes. Over his last three games he's averaged 15 points and six rebounds, so we'll see if his play continues to improve with more time in the starting lineup. Despite temporarily leaving the game with an injury, Marcus Smart returned and posted 13 points (3 - 9 FG, 2 - 7 3Pt, 5 - 6 FT) and three assists in 37 minutes. Carmelo Anthony did everything he could to keep the Knicks in this game, going for 21 points (9 - 23 FG, 1 - 5 3Pt, 2 - 2 FT), six rebounds and a steal. He's now combined for 52 points and 14 rebounds over his last two games, as he continues to be the team scoring leader. Jose Calderon shot very well, going 7 - for - 12 from the field and 3 - for - 4 from the three - point line to record 17 points. It was a nice surprise for the Knicks, as he's averaging only nine points per game on the season. Despite the loss, the Knicks also saw some decent production from the bench with both Tim Hardaway Jr and Lance Thomas finishing in double figures. Hardaway Jr had 14 points (5 - 11 FG, 2 - 3 3Pt, 2 - 2 FT) and two assists in 23 minutes, while Thomas posted 11 points (4 - 7 FG, 3 - 4 FT) and two assists in 25 minutes.

With Beno Udrih already sidelined with an ankle injury, the Grizzlies needed Mike Conley to shoulder the load at point guard. Conley suffered a head injury in the second half and was taken to a local medical facility for further examination, leaving his status for Game 4 up in the air.

Utah (33 - 22) entered the All-Star Break on a high note, blowing out the Blazers and reaching 11 games above .500. The Jazz were firing on all cylinders as they took Portland down, as the team shot 52 percent with six players scoring in double figures. All-Star Gordon Hayward scored a team - high 22 points while also grabbing six rebounds and dishing seven assists. Per usual, center Rudy Gobert backed up Hayward's scoring with dynamic defense and a solid effort on the glass. Gobert had 12 rebounds and blocked three shots. Portland (23 - 33) was as cold as Utah was hot. The Blazers shot an unimpressive 40 percent from the field, a large part of which was due to severe struggled from star point guard Damian Lillard. Lillard shot a hideous 3 - of - 19 from the field, ending with just 13 points. It was a stellar Blazers debut, however, for recently - acquired big man Jusuf Nurkic. Nurkic impressed off the bench, scoring 13 points and coming down with seven rebounds and three steals. The Nuggets, who dealt Nurkic to the Blazers earlier in the week, saw stellar play from former Blazer Mason Plumlee in his Denver debut. Thus far, both teams should be happy with their new big men's performance. Both teams will enter the All-Star Break. Table format: There are two tables. The first table has four columns and two rows.

Reigning MVP Steph Curry took over the game, scoring 51 points on 20 - for - 27 shooting including 10 three - pointers. Golden State continues to dominate at an all - time level, with the win keeping them on track to break the 1995 - 96 Bulls' regular season record of 72 - 10. Leading the charge has been reigning MVP Steph Curry, who delivered perhaps his best performance of the season on Thursday night. Curry shot the lights out while also recording seven rebounds and eight assists. The game also marked Curry's 128th consecutive outing with a made three - pointer, breaking the record for longest streak in NBA history. This may be unsurprising, though, as Curry is on track for countless all - time shooting records this year. With 266 three - pointers made this season, Curry is just 20 back from his own all - time record with 25 games remaining. Curry's season is currently fourth all - time in terms of three - pointers made, with Ray Allen being the only name ahead of him that is not his own. Curry's 32 PER is also on pace to break the single - season record held by Wilt Chamberlain. Now averaging 30 points per game, Curry is on pace to become just the second player of the 2010s to score in the 30s, after Kevin Durant. The star also figures to become the seventh member of the 50 - 40 - 90 club, as he boasts a shooting slash line of .508/.455/.912. Though Curry stole the show, Golden State saw solid performances top - to - bottom in Orlando. All-Star power forward Draymond Green made an impact on the defensive end with five steals while also dishing out eight assists on offense. As a team, Golden State recorded a whopping 35 assists and was simply unconscious from the field, shooting an elite 60 percent. The Warriors also managed to edge out Orlando on the glass, in what was an all - around win for the NBA's top team. Orlando, meanwhile, saw a solid and well - rounded effort against the reigning champs. All five members of the team's starting lineup scored at least 12 points, and the team managed to force 20 turnovers from the movement - oriented Warriors. Sophomore Aaron Gordon, who entered the starting lineup following the deadline trade of forward Tobias Harris, went for 19 points and eight rebounds on 9 - for - 14 shooting. Gordon made a name for himself on All-Star weekend as runner - up in the highly - rated Sprite Slam Dunk Contest, and he has played plenty of minutes since. He is averaging 12 points, 10 rebounds, and 3 steals since the All-Star break. The Warriors face a primetime matchup in Oklahoma City on Saturday night.

In a dominating effort, the Cavaliers got out to a quick start in this matchup, out - scoring the Lakers 64 - 49 in the first half alone. The Cavaliers were the superior shooters in this game as well, going 55 percent from the field and 55 percent from the three - point line, while the Lakers went just 41 percent from the floor and 30 percent from beyond the arc. The Cavaliers' big three of LeBron James, Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving did most of the damage in this one. Love led all scorers, finishing with 32 points (11 - 18 FG, 7 - 8 3Pt, 3 - 5 FT), 10 rebounds and three assists. After a dissapointing performance in Friday's game against the Pacers, where he finished with just five points, it was good to see him get things turned back around and play well. Also having an impressive showing, Irving recorded 28 points (10 - 14 FG, 5 - 8 3Pt, 3 - 4 FT), four rebounds and ten assists. It marked his fifth double - double of the season. Over his last two games, he's now combined for 57 points, eight rebounds and 15 assists, as he's been dominating his competition. James on the other hand, totaled 22 points (8 - 16 FG, 2 - 7 3Pt, 4 - 5 FT), 10 rebounds and eight assists, nearly recording a triple - double Sunday. He did n't have to do as much work as usual, considering the success of both Love and Irving. For the Lakers, rookie point guard Jordan Clarkson had a solid perfomance, finishing with 20 points (6 - 14 FG, 0 - 2 3Pt, 8 - 9 FT), six rebounds and four assists. It was a season - high in points for the rookie, who has now scored 14 points or more in five out his last six games, despite averaging only 7 per game on the season. He's been getting more and more comfortable in the starting lineup, and its beginning to show with more consistent play. Without much production from the rest of the starters, the Lakers bench had to put up some numbers. Ed Davis went 6 - for - 7 from the floor and 4 - for - 4 from the free throw line to finish with 16 points and nine rebounds in just 24 minutes. He's averaging only 8 points per game so far this season, so it was a nice surprise for the Lakers. Also coming off the bench, Wesley Johnson played well. In 29 minutes, he finished with 15 points (5 - 14 FG, 2 - 4 3Pt, 3 - 3 FT), two assists and two steals. The two steals matched a season - high.

Although the focal point of the Thunder\\'s (1 - 4) offense is usually located square at the point guard position, the team\\'s big men are certainly capable of impressively contributing in their own right. That facet was on full display Saturday, as Steven Adams and Enes Kanter combined for 34 points and 18 boards, helping to set the tone down low. Coupled with Russell Westbrook\\'s typically stellar output, Oklahoma City (5 - 1) posted an excellent 52 percent success rate from the field, as well as 44 percent from behind the arc, notably superior to the Timberwolves\\' respective 39 and 21 percent figures in those categories. The Timberwolves\\' starting five was decidedly top - heavy in terms of production, as Karl-Anthony Towns led the way with a game - high 33 points, which he supplemented with six rebounds and a block. He had little precious little help, however, as no other starter managed to even get into double digits on the scoring column. Gorgui Dieng struggled offensively for the second straight game, finishing with just eight points along with eight boards and four blocks. Andrew Wiggins and Zach LaVine were particularly underwhelming, totaling just seven and four points, respectively, on a combined 4 - of - 19 shooting tally. Shabazz Muhammed led the bench with 15 points and four rebounds. Westbrook led the Thunder with 28 points, eight assists, six rebounds and three steals. Adams contributed 14 points, eight boards, two assists, two steals and two blocks. Victor Oladipo posted 12 points, three rebounds, an assist and a steal, while Kanter paced the bench with a 20 - point, 10 - rebound double - double that also included an assist, a steal and a block.

Johnson was n\\'t even on an NBA roster two months ago and had n\\'t seen the floor since Feb. 23 when he played three minutes against the Philadelphia 76ers.

The Suns\\' Alex Len got into a bit of a brouhaha with Heat center Hassan Whiteside.

The Suns\\' new shooting guard Brandon Knight faced off against their recently - departed former shooting guard Goran Dragic. Knight played 40 minutes despite a hip pointer he suffered against the San Antonio Spurs over the weekend. He finished with 13 points, seven assists and five turnovers.

Despite the defeat, the Jazz were the superior shooters, going 38 percent from the field and 38 percent from the three - point line, while the Mavericks went 37 percent from the floor and 36 percent from deep. The Mavericks did force the Jazz into 19 turnovers though, while committing only 11 of their own, which may have been the difference in this one.

The second unit was particularly key, combining for 49 points overall. A trio of guards paced the Blazers, with reserve Allen Crabbe surprisingly at the top of the list. He managed 23 points, four rebounds and two assists over 28 minutes. Damian Lillard followed with 22 points, eight assists, three rebounds and one steal. C.J.

Both teams shot very poorly, as Houston shot 29 percent from the field and 20 percent from the three - point line, while Oklahoma City shot 29 percent from the field and 16 percent from beyond the arc. The Rockets did take a 54 - 45 rebounding advantage by the end of the game, which may have allowed them the ugly victory. For the Rockets, James Harden had a game - high 19 points, while also adding nine rebounds and five assists. He struggled with his three - point shot though, as he only went 2 - for - 9 from behind the three - point line. Dwight Howard came one rebound shy of his eigth double - double of the season, as he finished with 12 points and nine rebounds. He struggled offensively and could n\\'t reach his season average of 19 points per game. Trevor Ariza chipped in 11 points, but also shot pretty poorly, as he went 4 - for - 11 from the field and 1 - for - 4 from the three - point line. The Rockets bench had a meager eight total points, with Francisco Garcia scoring six of those eight, so they did n\\'t offer much help to the starters.

The Thunder were led by Lance Thomas and Reggie Jackson, who scored 15 points a piece. Jackson had a surprising season - high 11 rebounds, but shot only 3 - for - 11 from the field. Most of his points came from the free - throw line as he converted on a perfect nine for nine. The 15 points for Thomas were also a season - high for him, although like Jackson, he got most of his production from the free - throw line, where he made 7 - of - 8.The only other Thunder player to reach double figures was Serge Ibaka, as he contributed 10 points and six rebounds. Continuing to come off the bench since returning from MCL surgery, Anthony Morrow struggled mightily as well, shooting only 1 - for - 9 from the field and 0 - for - 2 from beyond the arc for four points.

Johnson enjoyed the second - best outing of his rookie campaign with 15 points off the bench. The Pistons improved to 7 - 5 and reside in third place in the Eastern Conference’s Central Division.

The Knicks (22 - 31) have been mired in controversy on and off the court in recent weeks, with rumors swirling about a possible trade of franchise cornerstone Carmelo Anthony and losses in three of their last four games. The Lakers (18 - 36) are n\\'t in much better shape, however, and came into Monday\\'s contest with only five road wins in 28 games away from the Staples Center this season. However, a sterling effort from the Los Angeles bench that generated over half of the team\\'s scoring total helped lead the way to a relatively easy victory. The visitors were sharp from the jump, building a 29 - 19 lead after one and a 61 - 45 advantage by halftime. That edge was 97 - 73 after three quarters, and even with New York showing some signs of life in garbage time, the Lakers still coasted to a double - digit road victory. The Lakers were led by Lou Williams off the bench, who tallied 22 points, four assists, two rebounds and one steal in 26 minutes. Nick Young was next and paced the starters with 17 points, which he complemented with five rebounds and one steal. Brandon Ingram and Julius Randle followed with matching 14 - point efforts, with the former also providing seven boards, two assists and one steal, and the latter offering two rebounds, two assists and one block. Tarik Black posted a modest nine points but hauled in 10 boards and recorded one steal. D\\'Angelo Russell (four points, six assists, two rebounds) was minimally involved, but Jordan Clarkson (12 points) and emerging rookie Ivica Zubac (10 points) were productive as reserves as well. The Knicks were paced by Anthony\\'s 26 points, which he supplemented with five assists, three rebounds and one steal. Kristaps Porzingis registered a near double - double of 16 points, nine boards and a pair of blocks. Brandon Jennings matched his total off the bench and added five assists, three rebounds and one steal. Justin Holiday was productive on the second unit as well with 14 points, one rebound and one block. Kyle O\\'Quinn drew the start at center and produced 10 points, two rebounds and one assist, while Derrick Rose, back in the starting lineup after a four - game absence due to an ankle injury, generated just five points, four rebounds and three assists over 32 minutes. Willy Hernangomez continued his strong play by tallying eight points, 13 rebounds, one assist, two steals and one block over 24 minutes off the bench.

Sixth man Jrue Holiday, however, stepped up to deliver 20 points and seven assists off the bench.

Dominating in all facets of this game, the Pacers got a much needed bounce back win after falling to the Bulls on Monday. They started quick, cruising to a 52 - 38 lead at the half. They then went on a 15 - 2 run to start the third quarter, pushing their lead to 27 points, which was too much for the Sixers to come back from. The Pacers put on a strong defensive performance as well, forcing the Sixers into a whopping 29 turnovers, 17 of which came in the first half. Paul George continued to put the team on his back Wednesday, finishing with a game - high of 34 points (13 - 24 FG, 5 - 10 3Pt, 3 - 4 FT), to go along with eight rebounds and five assists. His re - emergence has been huge for the Pacers, as he\\'s now posted eight straight games with 26 or more points. The fifth - year pro out of Fresno State is now averaging 25 points, 9 rebounds and 5 assists on the season.

He took advantage of the extra minutes, posting a season - high of 20 points (7 - 12 FG, 4 - 7 3Pt, 2 - 2 FT), while also adding four assists. Miles is on fire right now, combining to shoot an impressive 13 - of - 24 from the field and 9 - of - 15 from the three - point line over his last two outings. Chase Budinger chipped in with 15 points (5 - 13 FG, 1 - 4 3Pt, 4 - 4 FT) and six rebounds as well. Jahlil Okafor and T.J. McConnell were the only Sixers\\' players who got anything going Wednesday. Okafor finished with 14 points (6 - 11 FG, 2 - 4 FT) and six rebounds, while McConnell added a team - high of 16 points (7 - 9 FG, 2 - 3 3Pt), to go along with six rebounds and three assists. Okafor was coming off two impressive double - doubles prior to this game, so it was somewhat of a disappointing performance for the rookie scoring leader out of Duke. He\\'s now averaging 19 points, 8 rebounds and 1 assists on the season. McConnell, on the other hand, has now reached double figures in points in three out of his last four games, which was something he previously had n\\'t done this season. Jerami Grant added 13 points (4 - 6 FG, 0 - 1 3Pt, 5 - 6 FT), four rebounds and three blocked shots over 29 minutes as well.

The Pelicans were able to out - rebound the Pistons 47 - 30, giving them even more of an advantage and helping push them further to the victory.

Monroe on the other hand went 6 - for - 11 from the field and 4 - for - 7 from the free throw line to score 16 points, while adding eight rebounds and five assists as well.

Giannis Antetokounmpo led the team with 25 points (10 - 14 FG, 5 - 5 FT), while also adding six rebounds and two blocked shots. The 25 points were a new season - high for him and a nice surprise for the Bucks, as he's averaging only 11 points per game so far this season. Brandon Knight had a very solid performance as well, posting 24 points (7 - 17 FG, 4 - 7 3Pt, 6 - 6 FT), seven rebounds and eight assists in 36 minutes.

He was one rebound shy of a triple - double with 14 points, nine rebounds and 10 assists. After giving up a Kentavious Caldwell-Pope layup to start the game, Michael Carter-Williams hit a layup of his own and Philadelphia was off to the races.They would never relinquish the lead and held the Pistons to less than 22 points in each quarter. The Sixers are enjoying their best month of the season, having recorded five wins so far in January. Greg Monroe had a 20 - point, 11 - rebound double - double as the lone bright spot for the Pistons. The four other starters only managed to combine for 12 points total. D.J. Augustin had been filling in nicely at point guard for the Pistons, who will be without Brandon Jennings (Achilles) for the remainder of the season. Augustin averaged 27 points, 9 assists, four rebounds and one steal in his first two starts since taking over but could n't find the magic Wednesday.

This was a mismatch and blowout on paper and that proved to be the case on the court. The Warriors dominated from start to finish and it\\'s unclear if the Lakers even showed up to the game. This sort of game exemplifies which directions these franchises are going right now and we should give more credit to Golden State rather than belittling the Lakers. The biggest difference in the game was the passing, as the Warriors accumulated 32 assists compared to the Lakers 16. The Lakers came into this game as 18 - point underdogs and it was far worse than that. The Lakers got down by 20 points extremely early and never could bounce - back. This was a mismatch in nearly every facet, as the Warriors are the best offensive team in basketball, while the Lakers are one of the worst defenses. No starter for the Lakers scored over 10 points and that exemplifies the nightmare performance. Kobe Bryant also had another terrible game, as he shot just 1 - for - 14 to accumulate four points in the loss. Bryant is simply taking too many bad shots right now and while he could make those in the past, his legs just simply ca n\\'t handle them anymore. We\\'ve never seen him throw up air - balls and wedgies like he did in this game and it\\'s just hard to watch as a basketball fan right now. This is a bad team right now and with an aging veteran who dominates the ball, it\\'s hard to see them get any better. They have a few days off until they face the Portland Trail Blazers on Saturday in their next scheduled game. The Warriors came into this game trying to set a record for most wins to start a season and they achieved it in spectacular fashion. They destroyed a disheartened Lakers team and they appear to be the new Lakers of the past. In this game they had an amazing 32:8 assists - to - turnover ratio and that has been the key all season. Steph Curry played just 30 minutes in this game, but still totaled 24 points and nine assists in the blowout win. This is a scary team right now and the sky is the limit with the way they are currently playing.

A wild fourth quarter made for an exciting finish in Memphis.

The Pistons got up by as many as eight in the fourth but found themselves up 101 - 96 with three minutes left. From there until the end of the game Mario Chalmers was the only player to record any points, as he scored seven straight. First a lay up, then he got fouled on a three and hit all three free throws, tying the game at 101. Then after a steal by Matt Barnes, he managed to hit a wild jumper and was fouled, putting Memphis up 103 - 101 with .8 seconds on the clock and Chalmers at the line. Mario missed the free throw on purpose, in order to allow the clock to expire, improving the Grizzlies home record to 14 - 7. Matt Barnes was back in the line up after missing one game with a thumb contusion. Barnes\\' 18 points (6 - 7 FG, 6 - 6 3Pt), including sizzling 6 - 6 shooting from long range, three rebounds and two steals played an integral role in Memphis grinding out this victory. Mario Chalmers led all scorers, with 25 points (9 - 15 FG, 2 - 6 3Pt, 5 - 6 FT), along with eight assists, four steals and three rebounds, in 41 minutes. Chalmers started in place of Mike Conley, who missed his fifth game with a sore left achilles.

After the Grizzlies got off to a 100 to start the game, the Trail Blazers quickly came back and evened the score at the completion of the first quarter. The Grizzlies then again took a lead into half, but the Trail Blazers returned the favor in the third quarter and brought it back to within two. With the game going back and forth all throughout the fourth quarter, the Grizzlies finally got some separation with about four minutes left in the game and never looked back to secure the six - point victory in front of their raucous home crowd. Despite shooting just 1 - of - 14 from the three - point line, the Grizzlies still had enough production from their stars to pull off the win. With Mike Conley out with an injury, it was the Grizzlies\\' frontcourt that had the pressure on their shoulders. They did n\\'t disappoint, as Marc Gasol finished with 26 points (9 - 15 FG, 8 - 10 FT), 14 rebounds and two blocked shots, while Zach Randolph added 16 points (7 - 19 FG, 2 - 4 FT), eight rebounds and two assists. They did it on the defensive side of the ball as well though, limiting the Trail Blazers\\' frontcourt to a combined 24 points. The 14 rebounds from Gasol also helped the Grizzlies secure a huge 56 - 38 rebounding advantage over the Trail Blazers. Gasol has been one of the most consistent scorers throughout the playoffs thus far as well, as he boasts a 20 points per game average over five games. Courtney Lee was another player who did a fantastic job of making up for the loss of Conley in the backcourt. He went 8 - for - 12 from the field to score 20 points over 35 minutes. While they may have taken the loss, it was still a game to remember for the Blazers and CJ McCollum. McCollum went 12 - for - 20 from the field and 7 - for - 11 from the three - point line to score a career - high of 33 points. He actually surpassed his career - high even before the fourth quarter started, so it was even more impressive than originally thought. His performance broke a few records, as it was the first time in Blazers\\' history that a player hit seven three - pointers in a playoff game, while it was also the most bench points from a player so far in the 2015 NBA playoffs. Damian Lillard put his heart and soul into this game, but just could n\\'t connect on enough shots to keep his Blazers ahead. He finished with 22 points (8 - 19 FG, 1 - 8 3Pt, 5 - 6 FT) and six rebounds, but he did have six turnovers, so it was n\\'t the best performance for Lillard. In potentially his last game as a Blazer, LaMarcus Aldridge recorded just 14 points (5 - 18 FG, 4 - 5 FT) and nine rebounds before fouling out. It definitely was n\\'t the way he\\'d hoped to go out as he\\'ll now test free agency.

The Warriors had full control of this game from start to finish. They were able to jump out to an early lead and never look back, proving to have just too much offensive firepower that the Grizzlies were just unable to keep up with. Stephen Curry lead the way scoring for Golden State, scoring 22 points (8 - 18 FG, 4 - 8 3Pt) to go along with seven assists and four steals in 38 minutes. His running - mate in the backcourt, Klay Thompson, was not far behind, scoring 18 points (8 - 16 FG, 2 - 5 3Pt) and dishing out six assists in 38 minutes. Draymond Green’s streak of four straight games with a double - double came to an end, but he was still able to manage 16 points (5 - 11 FG, 4 - 8 3Pt), four rebounds and three assists in just 27 minutes. Harrison Barnes scored 11 points in 25 minutes, while Marreese Speights had 10 points in 13 minutes off the bench to round out the five Warriors players to score in double figures. As a team, the Warriors shot a fantastic 51 percent from the field and 46 percent from three while they recorded 26 assists on 39 made field goals to just 15 turnovers. For the Grizzlies, Marc Gasol lead the way scoring in the losing effort, putting up 21 points (5 - 10 FG, 11 - 12 FT), nine rebounds, three assists and three steals in 28 minutes, while Zach Randolph was not far behind, scoring 20 points (9 - 15 FG), grabbing nine rebounds and dishing out 5 assists in 36 minutes. Tony Allen was the only other Memphis player to score in double figures, finishing with 15 points on 6 - of - 11 shooting in 38 minutes. Offensively, it is clear the Grizzlies miss Mike Conley Jr., who sat out with an eye injury, as Conley’s replacement in the starting lineup, Nick Calathes, scored zero points on 0 - for - 4 shooting and dished out just two assists in 21 minutes. If Memphis wants any chance at winning this series, it is appears that they’ll need Conley back as soon as possible.

       "  'input': \"Input text: The Washington Wizards (7 - 8) defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers (13 - 5) 97 - 85 on Tuesday, handing the Cavs their first home loss of the 2015 - 16 campaign. The Wizards had been mired in an offensive slump of epic proportions recently, having scored 87 points or less over their last three games. If they were going to pull off the near - unimaginable Tuesday by upsetting the undefeated Cavs in Quicken Loans Arena, they would need a resurgent performance from their offensive linchipin, John Wall. The All-Star's recent performances had served as a microcosm of the team's overall offensive struggles, with Wall having tallied 20 points or less in all 11 of Washington's November contests, and having scored in single digits twice over that span. However, the light went on for the Wizards' point guard on Tuesday, as he exploded for a season - high 35 points and added 10 assists, four rebounds and five steals. After shooting 36 percent or worse in four of his preceding five games, the 25 - year - old enjoyed a stellar night from the field, draining 14 buckets in 24 attempts (58 percent). If Wall can begin to put together more efforts of this caliber, the Wizards have an opportunity to climb out of their early - season hole and eventually grab an Eastern Conference playoff spot. Wall's backcourt mate Bradley Beal posted his fifth consecutive game with double - digit points to support the offensive cause, amassing 18 points, nine rebounds and six assists. Marcin Gortat pitched in with his second consecutive double - double and third in four games, totaling an impressive 15 points, 11 rebounds, four blocks and a steal versus a Cleveland defense that had come into Tuesday yielding the second - least points and the least amount of rebounds per game to opposing centers. Jared Dudley fared better in his second start at power forward, collecting 12 points, three assists and a pair of rebounds, after only totaling seven points on Saturday versus the Raptors. Otto Porter (six points, five rebounds, two assists, one block) was the only Washington starter in single digits, while Garrett Temple paced the reserves with seven points and five rebounds over 28 minutes. The Wizards improved to 7 - 8 but still reside in last place in the Eastern Conference's Southeast Division. They head home to face the Lakers on Wednesday. LeBron James unsurprisingly led the Cavs in every offensive category, but Tuesday was a night where that simply was not enough. A key factor was the lack of support from James' season - long wing man in Kyrie Irving's absence, Kevin Love. While James was able to put together one of his typically stellar outings (24 points, 13 rebounds, four assists, a block and a steal), Love could only muster eight points, eight rebounds and a steal over 33 minutes. The fact that the Wizards had come in to Tuesday's game giving up the fifth - most points per game to opposing power forwards (22) made Love's final stat line all the more disappointing. J.R. Smith (13 points) and Mo Williams (12 points) did their best to contribute, but Smith in particular suffered through a third consecutive sub - par shooting night (3 - for - 14). Matthew Delladedova paced the Cavs' bench with a 15 - point effort over 27 minutes. Cleveland fell to 13 - 5 but still retains sole possession of first place in the Eastern Conference's Central Division. They head to New Orleans to face the Pelicans on Friday.

The Pistons shot an absurdly efficient 58 percent from the floor and 52 percent (12 - 23) from three - point land as their offense was too much for the Raptors to handle.

The most surprising showing though, had to be from Shelvin Mack off the bench, who racked up 23 minutes and scored an impressive 24 points (7 - 8 FG, 6 - 6 3Pt, 4 - 4 FT), with three assists and two rebounds.

Detroit (20 - 24) overcame inconsistent play and a sub - par bench performance for a blowout win against Atlanta. While finding production from their bench has been an issue for the Pistons throughout the season, the starting five was able to more than make up for it on Wednesday. Every starter scored at least 13, and the starting five helped lead a 42 - point first quarter that established an almost insurmountable lead for the Pistons. Pistons point guard Reggie Jackson led the team with 26 points on 50 percent shooting, while All-Star Andre Drummond crashed the glass for 17 rebounds. Altogether, Detroit showed very little weakness in the crushing win, shooting almost 50 percent and holding a 60 - 32 advantage in the rebounding column. The Hawks (24 - 18) had seen hot play in recent weeks but struggled severely on Tuesday. The team shot under 39 percent from the floor and was absolutely demolished on the boards. One area in which the Hawks struggled was three - point shooting, where the team went just 6 - of - 25 from the field. Atlanta was also unable to match up with Detroit's powerful starting five, as the Hawks' own starters looked shaky at best. Two starters combined for just four points and the starting five as a whole committed eight turnovers on the night. The Pistons will host the Wizards on Saturday while the Hawks will face the Bulls on Friday. Table format: There are two tables.   The first table has 7 columns and 2 rows.

However, on the coattails of LeBron James, Cleveland didn’t panic and came back strong, outscoring Philadelphia 64 - 40 over the next two quarters. James finished with a team - high 22 points (9 - 19 FG) and fell one rebound shy of a triple double, dishing out 11 assists and grabbing nine boards in 33 minutes. Mo Williams also was effective and continues to fill in nicely for Kyrie Irving, as the veteran point guard recorded 21 points in 28 minutes on 8 - of - 10 shooting from the field. J.R. Smith left Monday’s game after just five minutes with a right knee contusion, and as a result, Matthew Dellavedova saw more playing time off the bench and finished with 12 points (5 - 8 FG) and nine assists in 34 minutes. For the 76ers, Jahlil Okafor was once again efficient on offense, scoring a game - high 24 points (11 - 21 FG), but managed to grab just three rebounds in 27 minutes. Okafor’s partner in the frontcourt Nerlens Noel scored 14 points (7 - 13 FG), grabbed eight rebounds, and blocked three shots in 33 minutes. However, the surprise performance of the game came from backup rookie point guard T.J.

Free-throw shooting was the decisive statistic, with Indiana going 27 - of - 32 from the charity stripe, while Miami could only go 11 - of - 16. Fastbreak points was also a glaring difference, with the Pacers winning that battle, 160. The Heat (32 - 35) had to play this game without Goran Dragic (eye), as they simply did n't have enough bullets to beat this hungry Pacers team. Hassan Whiteside did all he could for Miami, as he totaled 26 points and 21 rebounds in the defeat. Dion Waiters was the only other starter in double figures, as he collected 20 points, eight rebounds and six assists. Wayne Ellington led the bench, as he dropped 19 points on 7 - of - 13 shooting. James Johnson also played well off the bench, providing 14 points and four rebounds. The Heat will be off until Wednesday, when they host the struggling New Orleans Pelicans for their next game. The Pacers (34 - 32) have been dominant at home all season, with this win giving them their 23rd home victory of the year. Paul George was the player of the game, tallying 28 points and 10 rebounds.

This was a close game the whole way, going back and forth with 14 lead changes and 12 ties. After Kemba Walker tied it up at 107 with 2 seconds left, the Pelicans called time out to set themselves up with a side inbound. The ball was inbounded to Jrue Holiday who ran a quick pick and roll with Anthony Davis. Holiday threw a perfect alley - oop pass to Davis who converted the play and sealed the win for the Pelicans. The Pelicans snapped a three - game home losing streak and gave Charlotte its ninth straight road loss. New Orleans has now won both its games since Anthony Davis returned to the lineup last Wednesday. Davis contributed a solid 22 points (8 - 14 FG, 6 - 7 FT), five rebounds, four assists, two blocked shots and one steal. Ryan Anderson was the hero though, as he finished with a game - high 32 points, (12 - 19 FG, 6 - 8 3Pt, 2 - 2 FT) and eight rebounds, in 28 minutes off the bench. Jrue Holiday chipped in 13 points (6 - 14 FG), 10 assists and six rebounds, in 27 minutes off the bench. Tyreke Evans was back in the lineup after missing games with a sore knee.

This was expected to be a high - scoring game, but the two offenses really struggled with both rosters being extremely shorthanded. That doesn’t mean it wasn’t a good game though, as the action in the closing minutes was just fantastic. Archie Goodwin was the hero, as he hit the game - winning three with less than a second to go. What won the game for the Suns was the rebounding though, as they snatched down 52 boards to the Hawks 43. Both teams shot 40 percent from the field and took a combined 58 three - pointers. Atlanta actually came into this game as a double - digit favorite, so it ended up being quite the upset. The Atlanta Hawks had to play this game without Paul Millsap and it\\'s obvious with this result how important he is to this team. Atlanta struggled mightily on the offensive end of the floor, as the post players for the Suns dominated this game. Kent Bazemore kept his team in it with some huge shots late and finished with 21 points and six rebounds. Al Horford had a nice all - around game as well, as he tallied nine points, 16 rebounds, five assists and two blocks in the defeat. Dennis Schroder once again played down the stretch and scored 16 points with Jeff Teague\\'s continuing to struggle. The Hawks will look to play better in their next game on Monday against the Denver Nuggets. The Suns played with some fire here for the first time in quite a while and the future is bright even though the present is dark. This was only their second win in their last 16 games, and it was easily their best defensive performance. Tyson Chandler was just a monster down low, as he snatched 17 rebounds in the first half alone. Chandler finished the game with 13 points, 27 rebounds and five assists in a spectacular performance. All the starters played well here, as all five players scored in double - figures and combined for 84 points. Archie Goodwin led the team with 24 points and has been filling in brilliantly for Brandon Knight, who is dealing with an abductor strain. Alex Len was a beast down low as well, as he amassed 16 points, 12 rebounds and five assists. Phoenix will look to build on this win when they take on the Philadelphia 76ers in their next game on Tuesday. Table format: There are two tables.   The first table has 5 columns and 3 rows.

The newly - acquired Arron Afflalo made his debut with the Blazers, playing 24 minutes off the bench and putting up eight points and four rebounds. Memphis had all five starters finish with double - digit points to help them collect the win in their first game back from the All-Star break. Marc Gasol was questionable for the game with an illness but was able to play through it to score a team - high 21 points in 36 minutes. Portland remains 5 games back from Memphis in the Western Conference standings.

While the Bucks shot better from field and the three - point line, they were dominated at the free throw line where the Spurs went 26 - for - 30 and the Bucks finished just 9 - for - 13. The Bucks also committed 21 turnovers, which may have been another big difference in this game. The Spurs had a strong showing from their frontcourt, as forwards Tim Duncan and Kawhi Leonard were the team - leaders in both points and rebounds. In 31 minutes, Duncan finished with 20 points (9 - 13 FG, 2 - 2 FT) and 11 rebounds, while Leonard had 19 points (4 - 11 FG, 1 - 5 3Pt, 10 - 12 FT) and 14 rebounds in 36 minutes.

He went 10 - for - 17 from the field and 4 - for - 8 from the three - point line to score a game - high of 34 points while also adding six assists in 29 minutes. He\\'s been dominant lately for the Celtics offensively, averaging 27 points over his last three games. Thomas received some help from Brandon Bass though, who added 16 points (5 - 7 FG, 0 - 1 3Pt, 6 - 6 FT) and four rebounds in 20 minutes as a starter. He\\'s now pushed his season averages to 11 points and 5 rebounds on the year. Also coming off the bench for an impressive performance was Jae Crowder, who chipped in with 17 points 4 - 8 FG, 0 - 1 3Pt, 9 - 9 FT) and six rebounds. Crowder has been dealing with an ankle injury recently, but he did n\\'t seem to have too many problems with it Wednesday. Kelly Olynyk reached double figures off the bench as well with 12 points (5 - 9 FG, 0 - 1 3Pt, 2 - 2 FT) in just 18 minutes. Despite taking the loss, it was Reggie Jackson who continued his strong play of late. He finished with a double - double, going for 21 points (10 - 18 FG, 1 - 2 3Pt) and 15 assists. It was n\\'t all good for the guard though, as he did record seven turnovers as well. It marked his second double - double in a row, a stretch where he\\'s combined to go 21 - for - 36 from the field and 3 - for - 6 from the three - point line to score 50 points. Both Andre Drummond and Greg Monroe posted a double - double of their own. Drummond finished with 22 points (11 - 19 FG, 0 - 1 3Pt, 0 - 3 FT) and 14 rebounds, while Monroe had 19 points (9 - 14 FG, 1 - 2 FT) and 10 rebounds. This marked the fifth game out of the last six that Drummond recorded double - digit rebounds. Both Jodie Meeks and Tayshaun Prince finished in double figures off the bench. Meeks went a perfect 4 - for - 4 from the field and 3 - for - 3 from deep to score 13 points, while Prince went 7 - for - 8 from the field and 1 - for - 1 from beyond the arc to finish with 15 points.

Los Angeles was lights - out from the field, shooting 51 percent from the field, 42 percent from three - point range and 88 percent from the free - three line. Turnovers really killed the Pelicans, as they committed 14, while forcing just nine from the Clippers. The Los Angeles starters controlled the game, outscoring the New Orleans starters, 77 - 48.

The Spurs new duo of top scorers, Kawhi Leonard and LaMarcus Aldridge, paved the road to the win with 27 and 26 points respectively. Aldridge added 16 total rebounds in what was one of his best statistical performances of the night. Aging veteran Tim Duncan contributed an unfortunate box score of 6 points, 6 rebounds, and 6 assists, but provided playmaking that helped bolster the Spurs' blowout win.

The Rockets are now in ninth place despite reaching the Western Conference Finals in 2014 - 15.

Despite the loss, the Warriors remain six and a half games ahead of the Grizzlies for the number one spot in the Western Conference standings. Helping pull off the win for the Nuggets was their shooting, as they went 50 percent from the field and 47 percent from the three - point line, while the Warriors finished at 42 percent from the floor and 42 percent from deep. The Nuggets continued to use their small lineup during Friday\\'s game, with Kenneth Faried getting the start at center.

       "  'input': 'Input text: The Washington Wizards (14 - 14) defeated the Brooklyn Nets (8 - 22) 111 - 96 on Saturday. Washington entered Saturday\\'s contest without the services of starters Bradley Beal (leg) and Otto Porter Jr. (thigh) once again, meaning that another heavy offensive load was likely in store for veteran leaders John Wall and Marcin Gortat, and to a lesser extent, the injured pair\\'s replacements, Garrett Temple and Kelly Oubre, Jr. As has been the case in several recent games, all four made notable contributions of varying degrees to help secure another victory for the surging Wizards. Gortat led the way scoring - wise with 25 points, and added seven rebounds, three assists, a block and a steal. Meanwhile, Wall racked up his fifth straight game with double - digit assists, dishing out 13 dimes and also posting 22 points of his own. Just as important, the 25 - year - old emerged from a 9 of 33 shooting funk over the preceding two games to drain 53 percent of his 17 attempts from the field. Overall, the Wizards\\' relentless attack allowed them to wear down Brooklyn, and they won going away on the strength of a final period in which they outscored the home team by the sizable margin of 32 - 19. Oubre\\'s tally of 12 points, six rebounds, an assist, a block and a steal were especially welcome on a night when frontcourt mate Jared Dudley considerably underwhelmed with only three points. Temple was a bit more understated than in recent games, but still pitched in nine points, three assists, a rebound, two steals and a block. Jarrell Eddie, just signed on Tuesday, paced the Washington bench with 12 points in his debut, while Kris Humphries poured in 10 of his own and added eight rebounds. The Wizards evened their record at 14 - 14 but remain in last place in the Eastern Conference\\'s Southeast Division. They head home to face the Clippers on Monday. Brooklyn received a trio of impressive double - doubles from their most dependable players, making the double - digit defeat even more frustrating. Brook Lopez (19 points, 11 rebounds) and Thaddeus Young (16 points, 14 rebounds) were a major reason the Nets outrebounded the Wizards 50 to 39, and both extended a streak of particularly strong recent play. It was the third double - double for Lopez in the last four games, while Young\\'s performance qualified as the fourth time in the last five contests that he\\'s posted double - digit points and boards. Meanwhile, Jarrett Jack was outstanding in his own right, contributing 15 points and dishing out 11 assists. Second-year forward Bojan Bogdanovic pitched in with his fourth straight double - digit scoring effort, managing 14 points and adding five rebounds and a pair of assists. Despite the strong contributions from most of the starters and the aforementioned advantage on the glass, the Nets were largely done in by a poor shooting night from three - point range (29 percent over 17 attempts) and the 20 total team turnovers they were guilty of. The Nets fell to 8 - 22 and remain in fourth place in the Eastern Conference\\'s Atlantic Division. They head to Miami to take on the Heat in a Monday night matchup.

The Raptors also won the points in the paint battle, 38 - 22, and won the fastbreak points, 14 - 5. Amazingly, the Celtics doubled up the Raptors in assists, winning that, 24 - 12. Toronto (16 - 7) continues to ride their backcourt to wins and they did that yet again here. Kyle Lowry was the star in this one, tallying 34 points, seven rebounds and three steals. DeMar DeRozan was n\\'t far behind, finishing with 24 points and five rebounds on 9 - of - 25 shooting. Norman Powell got the start for the resting DeMarre Carroll and totaled 20 points, three rebounds and five steals on 7 - of - 10 from the field. Patrick Patterson and Jonas Valanciunas both failed to reach double figures in scoring, but snatched down 10 boards a piece. The Raptors are off until Monday, when they host the surging Milwaukee Bucks. Boston (13 - 10) had to play this game without Isaiah Thomas and it really hurt them late when they needed a clutch basket. Al Horford did all he could to keep Boston hanging around, as he accumulated 19 points, seven rebounds and six assists in the defeat. Avery Bradley matched Horford with 19 points and five rebounds on 7 - of - 11 from the field. Marcus Smart and Jae Crowder really struggled shooting, as they combined to go 5 - of - 22 from the field.

The Lakers (20 - 47) were unable to match the shooting efficiency the Nuggets had going, and finished 30 percent from three point range and 43 percent from the field, compared to the lights out 54 percent effort by Denver. Nikola Jokic and Danilo Gallinari each scored 18 points, and combined for 12 rebounds and nine assists. Mason Plumlee scored 15 points and added 10 rebounds across 36 minutes.

The Bulls have defeated the Celtics and now the Pacers, after many people questioned how this new look team would gel. Chicago (20) came ready to play in this one as they poured in 62 points in the first half, while holding Indiana to only 41. Chicago then held on to maintain the lead for the entire second half. The Bulls had good contribution throughout their roster as they were dominated the rebounds and had six players scoring in double figures. Doug McDermott was the high - point man, with 23, while Rajon Rondo dished 13 assists to get his guys going. The Bulls will be back in action on Monday, when they visit Brooklyn. The Pacers (1 - 2) were perhaps fatigued on the second night of a back - to - back, which began with a loss against Brooklyn on Friday night.

Seven Lakers reached double digits in scoring, with the young backcourt duo of sophomore Jordan Clarkson and rookie D\\'Angelo Russell combining for 46 points. Russell, less than a week removed from his career - high 39 points on Tuesday, scored 21 while dishing out five assists. The rookie was also a pest on the defensive end, grabbing four steals. European rookie Marcelo Huertas led the team with nine assists off the bench, giving fire to the second unit in the stunning upset. Coach Byron Scott said Huertas was \"probably [the team\\'s] MVP\" when asked for comment on the rookie\\'s impressive showing.The Lakers smoked Golden State in terms of shooting, hitting nine three - pointers to the Warrior\\'s four, and shooting an efficient 47 percent from the field. Though LA maintains the league\\'s second - worst record, they were able to expose the Warriors, dealing them their sixth and second - largest loss of the season. Normally the best three - point shooting team in the league, Golden State hit just four from deep in Los Angeles. After one of the most impressive individual weeks in recent memory last week, Steph Curry went just 1 - for - 10 from three - point land on Sunday. Curry was one of just two Warriors to reach double digit scoring, as seemingly nothing would fall for the NBA\\'s top team. Turnovers also presented an issue, as the team coughed the ball up 20 times as a whole. Seven of those turnovers came from first - time All-Star Draymond Green, who also failed to prevent sophomore Julius Randle from crashing the board 14 times by the day\\'s end. Golden State will now need a record of at least 18 - 3 to finish the season in order to be in sole possession of the best single season in NBA history.

The Heat got off to a strong start in this one, out - scoring the Celtics 44 - 31 in the first half alone. They were superior shooters in this game, going 42 percent from the field, while the Celtics went just 37 percent from the floor. The Heat also secured a 46 - 40 rebounding advantage. For the Heat, Hassan Whiteside just kept on going Sunday, recording another impressive performance. In 29 minutes, Whiteside finished with 20 points (10 - 17 FG), nine rebounds and three blocks. He came just one rebound shy of notching his fourth double - double in a row, a stretch where he\\'s averaging 17 points, 16 rebounds and four blocks over those four games. Chris Bosh also had a solid showing, posting 18 points (6 - 19 FG, 1 - 4 3Pt, 5 - 7 FT), seven rebounds and two assists. It was n\\'t his best day shooting the ball, but he still did enough to help secure the victory, even with both Dwyane Wade (hamstring) and Luol Deng (calf) sitting out with injuries. Coming off the bench, Tyler Johnson was the only other player in double figures, fininshing with 13 points (4 - 9 FG, 1 - 3 3Pt, 4 - 6 FT), nine rebounds, four assists and two steals in 27 minutes. This was only his third game of the season, while the points, rebounds and assists were all season - highs for the rookie. The Celtics saw their biggest production from the duo of Avery Bradley and Tyler Zeller. Bradley finished with 17 points (8 - 15 FG, 1 - 4 3Pt), four rebounds and two assists, while Zeller had 17 points (6 - 13 FG, 5 - 8 FT), six rebounds and four assists. Bradley shot a combined 8 - for - 27 from the field over his last two games, so it was good to see him shoot the ball a little better on Sunday. Zeller is only averaging 9 points per game so far this season, so his points totals were a nice surprise for the Celtics, despite the loss. The only other Celtic to reach double figures in points was Brandon Bass, who went 7 - for - 14 from the field to record 15 points, while also adding six rebounds and two blocked shots. He\\'s started to heat up, as he\\'s combined for 32 points and 14 rebounds over his last two games.

Likely a bit spooked by both their performance over the last two games, and the throttling suffered by the other postseason presumptive favorite down in Oklahoma City in their last pair of contests, the Cavaliers came out with impressive tunnel vision in Game 5. They ambushed the visiting Raptors right out of the gate, winning the first quarter by a margin of 37 - 19. The rout was on, as Cleveland took a massive 65 - 34 advantage into halftime, a lead that eventually ballooned to 100 - 60 by the end of the third period. A major difference Wednesday night was the return to prominence of Kevin Love, who'd shot 5 - for - 23 over the previous two games. Love exploded for a game - high 25 points, and supplemented the scoring with two assists, two rebounds, two blocks and a steal. As the final score would indicate, the Cavs outclassed Toronto in every offensive category. They shot 57 percent from the field while holding their guests to a 39 percent figure, and drained 48 percent of their three - point attempts while limiting the Raptors to a 18 percent success rate from beyond the arc. The domination continued down low, where they outrebounded Toronto by a 48 - 27 margin and outscored them in the paint, 46 - 32. The Raptors were led by DeMar DeRozan, who compiled 14 points, three rebounds, three assists, two steals and a block. Kyle Lowry followed with 13 points, six assists, three rebounds and a steal. Bismack Biyombo was held in check, as he supplied a modest seven points, four rebounds and a block. DeMarre Carroll and Luis Scola, the other two members of the starting five, could only combine to supply 12 points. One bright spot for Toronto in the lopsided loss was Jonas Valanciunas' return, as he collected nine points and an assist in just over 18 minutes on the court to lead the second unit. LeBron James was second to Love on Cleveland with a 23 - point tally, which he complemented with eight assists, six rebounds, two steals and a blocked shot. Kyrie Irving was next with 23 points, and he added three rebounds, three assists, three steals and a block. Tristan Thompson provided a near double - double with nine points, 10 boards, a steal and a block. Reggie Jefferson paced the reserves with 11 points, six rebounds and an assist in 20 minutes. With the comfortable margin of victory, the Cavs were able to give their first unit plenty of rest, as James' 31 minutes served as the highest allotment of playing time among the starters. The series returns to the Air Canada Centre in Toronto for Game 6 on Friday night, as the Raptors will try to stave off elimination. Table format: <NEWLINE>  There are two tables.

The Pacers shot just 41 percent from the field and 26 percent from long range. Rebounding was a glaring difference as well, with Toronto winning that battle, 51 - 33. The Pacers (35 - 34) have now traded off wins and losses across their last 13 games, as they continue their pursuit for mediocrity. Paul George led the way for Indiana, as he tallied 18 points, four rebounds and two assists. Thaddeus Young finished with 16 points and four rebounds on 7 - of - 9 shooting. Jeff Teague accrued 16 points and seven assists. Monta Ellis was the only other Pacer in double figures, as he provided 10 points and three assists off the bench. On deck for the Pacers is a home matchup against the Utah Jazz on Monday. The Raptors (41 - 29) have been struggling without Kyle Lowry, but this was a huge win over a conference rival. DeMar DeRozan was the player of the game, as he accumulated 22 points, three rebounds and four assists. Serge Ibaka totaled 16 points and five rebounds. Jonas Valanciunas recorded a double - double, amassing 11 points and 13 rebounds. Cory Joseph started for Lowry and collected 11 points, four rebounds and nine assists. Norman Powell and Jakob Poeltl each scored in double figures off the bench. Toronto will look to build off this win on Tuesday against the Chicago Bulls.

It was Jackson\\'s third double - digit scoring game against Boston this season, and the second of those three contests where he\\'s scored over 20 points. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope made it a strong night for the Detroit backcourt by tallying 20 points, four rebounds, an assist and a steal. Andre Drummond had a rare sub - par outing, managing 13 points, five rebounds, a pair of steals and a pair of blocks.

Evan Turner had another solid effort in place of Avery Bradley (hip), tallying 17 points and hauling in six boards. Amir Johnson and Jae Crowder pitched in with a pair of 16 - point efforts, with the former making it a double - double by posting 11 rebounds, and the latter adding four rebounds and a pair of steals. Kelly Olynyk contributed 10 points, five rebounds and four assists to round things out for the front - line players, and Jared Sullinger led the reserves with eight points.

However, Madison Square Garden saw a hard - fought game with big performances from young players on both sides. For the Knicks, rookie Jerian Grant took the reigns as a starter and rolled with them, scoring 14 points and dishing out four assists while commiting just two turnovers. While lottery pick Kristaps Porzingis sat out with a shoulder injury, the team saw promise in the form of Grant\\'s command of the floor. Guard Langston Galloway also had a big night off the bench, contributing a team - high 18 points as well as seven assists and six rebounds. For the Nets, meanwhile, young power forward Thomas Robinson exploded for a 14 - point, 13 - rebound double - double. With no Thaddeus Young, the youngster showed promise on both ends, also nabbing five steals on the defensive side of things. Ultimately, however, the Nets shot just a dismal 36 percent from the field and an even more paltry 17 percent from beyond the arc.

The Rockets had several opportunities to pull away throughout the game, but Dallas always seemed to find an answer. That is, until the fourth quarter, when Dallas stopped being able to counter Houston\\'s haymakers. The Rockets were able to space the floor and find open cutters throughout the fourth, which led to them outscoring the Mavericks 30 - 19 to close out the game. Josh Smith led the charge in the fourth with his passing as he dished out seven assists, including a couple alley - oops, in the final period. Smith matched his playoff career - high for assists with nine and also added 15 points and eight rebounds to help Houston hold serve on its home court. The series will transition to Dallas on Friday for Game 3. Dallas was short - handed coming into Game 2 with Chandler Parsons (knee) and Devin Harris (toe) sidelined, but things were made worse by Rajon Rondo\\'s unimpactful outing. In just 10 minutes on the floor, Rondo picked up four fouls, including a technical foul, and four points before being replaced by a combination of J.J Barea and Raymond Felton. Coach Rick Carlisle said after the game that it was his decision to hold Rondo out of the game after picking up four fouls. Dirk Nowitzki finished with just 10 points on an uncharacteristically poor 3 - of - 14 shooting performance. Al-Farouq Aminu provided a spark off the bench on the defensive end with two steals and three blocks. The Mavericks will look to get back into the series Friday on their home floor.

Howard played 33 minutes Tuesday and led the Rockets with 28 points while also adding 12 rebounds and two blocks.

The Pelicans had only a two - point lead heading into halftime, but were able to out - score the Knicks 50 - 41 in the second half, allowing them to coast to a victory in front of their home crowd. The Pelicans secured a heavy rebounding advantage, as they out - rebounded the Knicks 43 - 30, only furthering the advantage to the Pelicans in this one. While Anthony Davis is usually relied upon to guide the Pelicans, it was Tyreke Evans who took the lead on Tuesday. Evans shot a fantastic 11 - for - 15 from the field and 1 - for - 2 from the three - point line to score a game - high of 27 points, while also handing out six assists. It was nice bounce back game for him after shooting only 33 percent against the Lakers on Sunday. While Davis did n\\'t have the most points, he still contributed 18 points (6 - 14 FG, 6 - 9 FT), eight rebounds and three blocks. While his totals were well below his season averages of 25 points and 11 assists, it was still enough to get the Pelicans a victory. Omer Asik chipped in with 16 points and 14 rebounds, giving him his fifth game in a row with at least 10 rebounds. It was also his fifth double - double of the year. Jrue Holiday was the only other Pelican to reach double figures in points, as he finished with 13 points (6 - 10 FG, 0 - 1 3Pt, 1 - 1 FT), seven assists and six rebounds. As has been the case over the last few weeks, the Knicks received most of their production from Carmelo Anthony and Amare Stoudemire.

It was a season high for Stoudemire, who\\'s only reached the 20 - point mark one other time this season. Anthony on the other hand shot 6 - for - 11 from the field and 2 - for - 4 from the three - point line to score 17 points and added eight rebounds. He did n\\'t get nearly as many shots off as he has most of the season so far, so it resulted in scoring less than his season average of 23 points per game. With the other starters struggling to make an impact, the only other player to reach double figures was Jason Smith, who came off the bench to score 17 points (6 - 18 FG, 2 - 6 3Pt, 3 - 4 FT).

While currently riding an eight - game losing streak, the Knicks were able to overcome the drought and secured a victory in a double - overtime thriller. With just six seconds left in regulation, Langston Galloway came up clutch for the Knicks and hit a three - point shot to tie the game. Anthony Tolliver had a shot to win it at the buzzer, but instead it went into overtime. In the first overtime, it was the Pistons who came up with the clutch bucket at the end of the period, as Greg Monroe made a layup to even the score with 12 seconds left, eventually pushing it to a second overtime. The Knicks took off in the second overtime though, and finished off the surprising six - point victory on road, which marked just their eleventh total win on the season. The Knicks saw a huge contribution from Andrea Bargnani, who posted a team - high of 25 points (10 - 20 FG, 1 - 2 3Pt, 4 - 5 FT), to go along with 12 rebounds and four assists. He has only played eight games so far this season, and this was far - and - away his most productive showing. The point, rebound and assist numbers were all season - highs, while the double - double was his first of the year as well. Posting a double - double of his own, Lou Amundson was very effective, finishing with 17 points (8 - 16 FG, 1 - 1 FT), 14 rebounds and three blocked shots. Despite averaging just 4 points per game, he\\'s now posted double figures in points in three straight games, after previously hitting that mark only once so far this year.

He shot a combined 7 - for - 24 from the field over his last two games, so it was refreshing to see him find increased succes during Friday\\'s matchup. Coming off the bench, Shane Larkin added 16 points (5 - 9 FG, 1 - 3 3Pt, 5 - 5 FT) and three assists. For the Pistons, the frontcourt duo of Greg Monroe and Andre Drummond were a huge reason for their success. Each recorded a double - double, as Monroe posted 28 points (9 - 13 FG, 10 - 15 FT), 13 rebounds and two blocked shots, while Drummond finished with 21 points (9 - 11 FG, 3 - 7 FT), 15 rebounds and four blocked shots. Drummond has been on an absolute tear of late, posting four double - doubles in a row, while averaging 19 points and 15 rebounds over that span. He\\'s averaging 13 points and 13 rebounds on the season. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope gave the frontcourt some help as well and recorded 19 points (7 - 18 FG, 3 - 11 3Pt, 2 - 2 FT) and six rebounds. Like Drummond, he\\'s playing at a very high rate, averaging 21 points over his last three games. Both Reggie Jackson and Jodie Meeks reached double - digit points as well. Jackson finished with 16 points (5 - 24 FG, 1 - 5 3Pt, 5 - 5 FT) and five assists, while Meeks notched 16 points (5 - 8 FG, 2 - 4 3Pt, 4 - 6 FT) and two assists.

The Grizzlies (40 - 30) have extended their winning streak to four games, with this win being the most impressive of the bunch.

Jokic came off a career - high 30 points against the Magic for 29 on Tuesday, also recording 15 rebounds and three blocks. Seven of Jokic\\'s rebounds came on the offensive end, as the young center made a major impact for the Nuggets\\' offense. Although starting shooting guard Gary Harris (ankle) missed the tilt in Los Angeles, Denver seemingly had no trouble making up for his missing offensive output. Versatile wing Will Barton slid into the starting lineup in Harris\\'s place and contributed 26 points to go with eight assists. Barton was just one piece of a well - oiled Denver offense, as the team dished out 29 assists and shot over 56 percent on the night. The Lakers (15 - 31) very nearly came back from a double - digit deficit in the fourth quarter. Despite trailing by just two with under a minute to play, Los Angeles was unable to come away with a much - needed home win. One of Los Angeles\\'s main issues on Tuesday was one that has plagued the team throughout the season - disappointing play from the starting five. Four Lakers came off the bench for double digit points, including 24 for former Sixth Man of the Year Lou Williams and 19 for guard Jordan Clarkson, who was listed as questionable with an ankle injury prior to the game. Nevertheless, struggles from the starters ended up burying the Lakers.

Houston got off to a quick start Tuesday, out - scoring the Mavericks 31 - 22 right away in the first quarter. The Mavericks were able to slowly make their way back throughout the game though, eventually coming to within five points with just over two minutes left in the game. The Rockets never let off the gas pedal though and closed out strong for the series clinching nine - point victory. The Rockets finished at 45 percent from the field and 32 percent from the three - point line, while the Mavericks shot 38 percent from the floor and just 19 percent from deep. Superstars James Harden and Dwight Howard were the biggest reasons that the Rockets were finally able to take the next step in the playoffs. Howard finished with 18 points (7 - 14 FG, 4 - 10 FT), 19 rebounds and four blocked shots, while Harden recorded a game - high of 28 points (9 - 19 FG, 4 - 8 3Pt, 6 - 6 FT), to go along with eight assists. Howard was a force on the boards, helping the Rockets secure a 53 - 47 rebounding advantage. It marked his 32nd career playoff game with at least 15 rebounds. Harden, on the other hand, did what he does best and that's score the ball at a very high rate. The Mavericks just did n't have an answer for him on the defensive side of the ball and he continued his season dominance.

Nowitzki really struggled with his shot early in the game, as he was never really able to get himself into a groove, but he played with a lot of heart and continually tried to bring his team back. Ellis, on the other hand, had a nice game shooting the ball. He did seem to bang up his knee late in the fourth quarter, so that's something to watch heading into the offseason.

This marked the Bulls ninth - straight loss in Denver, but they lost more than that.

Despite the clutch play, Melo ended up committing a costly crunch - time turnover when switched onto Avery Bradley. Sophomore big man Kristaps Porzingis had 22 points and 12 rebounds, while point guard Derrick Rose contributed 25.

The Cavaliers took down the Brooklyn Nets on Wednesday as well, so the Raptors avoided dropping another game back with a loss. The Timberwolves have now tied the New York Knicks for the worst record in the league, so they\\'ll battle it out to see who will give themselves the best chance of landing the number one overall pick in this year\\'s draft from here on out. DeMar DeRozan really struggled with his shot in this game, going just 4 - of - 14 from the field. He made up for it at the free throw line though, as he forced his way into 12 attempts, while converting on all 12 of those attempts to push his scoring total to a team - high of 21 points. DeRozan continues to score at a very high rate, considering he\\'s surpassed the 20 - point mark in eight of his last nine games. Over his last 10 games, he\\'s now averaging 22 points, 4 rebounds and 3 assists. Jonas Valanciunas put in a good effort as well, notching a double - double with 15 points (7 - 9 FG, 1 - 2 FT) and 15 rebounds in just 23 minutes. It was his second double - double in a row, as he\\'s combined for 29 points and 27 rebounds over his last two games. Terrence Ross was dialed in with his shot as well. He went 6 - for - 9 from the field and 3 - for - 5 from beyond the arc to score 15 points. Unfortunately for the Raptors, Kyle Lowry had to leave the game during the third quarter with what looked like a lower back injury and was not able to return. While they were unable to pull off the win, Kevin Martin had himself a game. He went 14 - for - 28 from the floor and 5 - for - 9 from the three - point line to score a game - high of 37 points, while also adding seven rebounds. He\\'s picked up his scoring of late with so many injuries affecting this team, as he\\'s averaging 18 points while shooting 45 percent from the field during his last four games. Andrew Wiggins also did his best to keep his team close. He went 6 - for - 9 from the field and 3 - for - 4 from the free throw line to score 15 points. After shooting 40 percent or lower in each of his last three games, it was good to see the forward get back on track Wednesday. Coming off the bench, Chase Budinger matched a season - high of 19 points (9 - 18 FG, 1 - 5 3Pt, 0 - 1 FT), to go along with eight rebounds. It was his second solid showing in a row, after scoring 18 points Monday. Ricky Rubio returned after missing two games, but had just two points (1 - 4 FG, 0 - 1 3Pt) and eight assists in 30 minutes. The Raptors\\' next game will be on the road against the Chicago Bulls on Friday, while the Timberwolves will travel to New York to play the Knicks on Thursday. Table format: There are two tables.

They\\'ve had a terrific start to the season and have n\\'t shown any signs of slowing down. While DeMarcus Cousins\\' line of 31 points and 18 rebounds is no great shock due to the frequency in which he put up such amazing lines, Ben McLemore\\'s 22 points and nine rebounds gave McLemore the best game of his young career. Even retread Derrick Williams got in on the funk train Saturday against his former team. Williams put up 12 points and six rebounds in 30 minutes. The Kings continue their road trip against the Pelicans in New Orleans on Tuesday. Minnesota has lost two straight and seven of their last eight games. Injuries can be blamed for the depth of the Timberwolves\\' struggles this season, but they were never considered a team with much of a shot at a playoff spot in the stacked Western Conference. An argument could be made that the injuries the Timberwolves continue to suffer are a blessing in disguise considering that it\\'s forcing the team to give their young talent run against top - flight teams. Andrew Wiggins scored a career - high 29 points in 41 minutes Saturday. Mo Williams helped Wiggins get those points. Williams finished with 11 points and 12 assists for his second double - double in the last three games. The Timberwolves have three days off before hosting the Milwuakee Bucks on Wednesday.

This win marks the third in a row for the Blazers, as they currently sit as the third projected playoff seed in the Western Conference standings, just one game back from the Grizzlies and one game ahead of the Rockets. The Raptors, on the other hand, have lost eight of their last ten games, but sit tied for the third projected playoff seed with the Chicago Bulls in the Eastern Conference standings. The Trail Blazers shot well in this outing, going 52 percent from the field and 45 percent from the three - point line, while the Raptors went 47 percent from the floor and just 28 percent from deep. With all five starters reaching double figures in points, it was a nice team - effort win for the Trail Blazers on Sunday. Damian Lillard and LaMarcus Aldridge led the way, as each surpassed the 20 - point mark. Aldridge went 9 - for - 14 from the field and 6 - for - 8 from the free throw line to score a team - high of 24 points, while also adding 10 rebounds and five assists. It marked his second double - double over his last three games, a stretch where he's averaging 24 points and 10 rebounds. Lillard, on the other hand, finished with 23 points (10 - 2 - FG, 2 - 8 3Pt, 1 - 2 FT) of his own, to go along with five assists and two steals. He's played well of late, combining for 51 points and 14 assists over his last two games. On the season, he's now averaging 21 points, 5 rebounds and 6 assists per game. Nicolas Batum was able to notch a double - double as well, posting 10 points (3 - 5 FG, 2 - 2 3Pt, 2 - 2 FT) and 12 assists over 34 minutes. It was just the second time this season that he's reached double - digit assists. Despite suffering the loss, DeMar DeRozan had a solid performance for the Raptors, finishing with 22 points (9 - 18 FG, 0 - 1 3Pt, 4 - 5 FT) and eight rebounds. He really struggled with his shot in Friday's game against the Heat, shooting just 25 percent (3 - 12 FG) from the field in that outing, so it was good to see him get things pointed back in the right direction Sunday. Jonas Valanciunas went a perfect 7 - for - 7 from the field to score 14 points, while also pulling down nine rebounds in 22 minutes. Valanciunas missed Friday's game following the birth of his son, so it was good to see him come back without missing a beat. Struggling with his shot, Kyle Lowry ended with just 10 points (3 - 11 FG, 1 - 5 3Pt, 3 - 3 FT), but added six assists and four rebounds. He had shot a combined 17 - for - 31 from the field and 10 - for - 17 from the three - point line over his last two games, so his performance Sunday was somewhat of a disappointment.

A game between two teams officially out of playoff contention turned out to be a competitive and entertaining affair. With defense being an Achilles\\' heel of both clubs, there were plenty of strong offensive performances to go around. Both the Suns and Bucks enjoyed particularly strong shooting nights, with Phoenix\\'s solid 45 percent success rate from the field exceeded by Milwaukee\\'s even stronger 48 percent figure. The pivotal factor in the loss for the Suns was the turnover battle, which they lost by a notable margin of 22 - 13. The starting backcourt of Devin Booker and Brandon Knight was unfortunately guilty of 12 of those miscues, and Milwaukee was able to convert Phoenix\\'s mistakes to 27 points overall. The Suns were led by an outstanding effort from P.J. Tucker, who contributed 20 points, 10 rebounds, seven assists and three steals. Booker had a relatively quiet night on the scoreboard by his recent standards, but still totaled 18 points, four rebounds and four assists. The rookie did get in his own way plenty however, turning the ball over a game - high seven times. Alex Len followed with a remarkable double - double of his own, totaling 17 points, 15 boards, five assists and two blocks. Knight matched Len\\'s point total, and added two rebounds, two assists and five turnovers of his own. Tyson Chandler rounded out the starting five\\'s successful night with 13 points, 13 rebounds, three assists and two blocked shots.

With news coming down that star big man LaMarcus Aldrige will miss 6 - to - 8 weeks with a torn ligament in his thumb, the Trail Blazers got to see first hand how much Aldridge will be missed. Thomas Robinson got the start at power forward and performed admirably, scoring nine points and pulling down 12 rebounds. In the final seconds, Jared Sullinger had the ball knocked away, recovered it, and fired a pass from his backside to a wide - open Evan Turner, who buried a three from the corner to give Boston the lead. The Trail Blazer dropped just its fifth game at home. Boston is now 1 - 1 on its six - game Western Conference road trip after getting a surprise win over Portland. This win took a concerted effort from the Celtics starters, with Sullinger, Brandon Bass, and Avery Bradley turning in solid performances. Boston will have a quick turnaround as it will travel to Denver to take on the Nuggets on Friday. The Trail Blazers had one second on the clock to salvage a win over a Boston team that had lost twice as many games as it had won entering Thursday, but their inbound play was doomed from the start as they were unable to get a shot off before the clock hit zero. While rebounding was n\\'t an issue for Portland in Aldridge\\'s absence, their offensive efficiency was a cause for concern. Portland shot just 37 percent from the floor and got very little scoring from Aldridge\\'s replacements. The Trail Blazers will try to right the ship Saturday against the Wizards before embarking on a four - game road swing. Table format: <NEWLINE>  There are two tables.

The Warriors continue to play without Andre Iguodala (ankle) and Shaun Livingston has received a boost in minutes with the NBA Finals MVP on the sideline.. Livingston was not a standout in the box score, but still posted a 22 plus - minus with impressive defense and poise. Draymond Green was not flashy in the scoring department, but was effective in the rebounding battle after scoring 6 points, in addition to 11 rebounds and 10 assists in 28 minutes.

The Grizzlies also secured a 40 - 35 rebounding advantage, further helping to secure an impressive 19 - point victory on the road. Zach Randolph was a force in this game, going 10 - for - 15 from the field and 2 - for - 4 from the free throw line to score 22 points, while also adding 10 rebounds. It was his second impressive performance in a row, combining for 46 points and 20 rebounds over that span. It was also his tenth straight double - double.

The Spurs shot 41 percent from the field and 29 percent from the three - point line, while the Mavericks finished at 41 percent from the field and 27 percent from deep. While the majority of the outing had the two teams interlocked, the Spurs were able to secure a 52 - 46 rebounding advantage, which may have been just enough to pull out the victory. The Spurs leaned on Kawhi Leonard again in this one. He came in the clutch, scoring five of the Spurs\\' final six points, all within the last minute of the fourth quarter.

Aldridge sat out the last two games with an ankle injury, so it was good to see the ninth - year forward finish the game without any setbacks. Tony Parker was the only other Spurs\\' player in double figures, chipping in with 16 points on 7 - of - 11 shots from the field.

After a second and third quarter where the Nets combined to out - score the Magic 64 - 36, they entered the fourth riding a 25 - point lead. The Magic were n\\'t done though, and went on a huge fourth quarter comeback, pulling all the way back to within two points. Their comeback effort came up just short though, as they just did n\\'t have enough time to complete it. The Nets used superior shooting in this one, as they went 57 percent from the field compared to the Magic who went just 42 percent from the floor. The Nets continued to bring both Brook Lopez and Deron Williams off the bench, as they they both came in on a minutes restriction. Williams seemed to get a much longer run Friday, as he played 29 minutes compared to playing closer to 20 minutes the last four games. He cashed in on the extra time, going 5 - for - 10 from the field and 3 - for - 3 from the three - point line to score 16 points, while also handing out seven assists. Lopez on the other hand played just 17 minutes, but was very efficient with his time on the court and recorded 16 points (7 - 8 FG, 2 - 3 FT) and eight rebounds. He was placed in the starting lineup on Tuesday because of an injury to Kevin Garnett, but was reduced to a bench role again with his return. Mason Plumlee also had a strong game and continued to start at center. He went 9 - for - 10 from the field to score a team - high of 18 points, while also grabbing nine rebounds and adding two blocks. The Magic got help from all over the place, with seven players reaching double figures in points. Victor Oladipo led the team, going 7 - for - 13 from the field and 2 - for - 2 from beyond the arc to score 17 points.

The nine rebounds matched a season - high, while it was his second double - double of the year. Ben Gordon also gave a solid contribution off the bench. He went 5 - for - 9 from the field and 1 - for3 from the three - point line to score 14 points in 19 minutes. Tobias Harris and Nikola Vucevic had 12 and 10 points respectively.

Los Angeles shot 48 percent from the field, with Sacramento shooting 44 percent on their end. The game really changed in the third quarter, as the Clippers outscored the Kings 34 to 16.

While they were down three points coming out of the first quarter, the Celtics had a monster second quarter, out - scoring the Nuggets 35 - 22 and set themselves up to seal the four - point victory in the end. Despite each team shooting close to the same percentage from the floor, the Celtics took a huge advantage from behind the arc, going 43 percent from the three - point line, while the Nuggets finished at a meager 17 percent from deep.

He was very efficient with his time on the court, playing well on both offense and defense. It was his third straight game with two steals.

After a grueling 108 - 105 double overtime loss to the Bucks last Saturday in Milwaukee, Cleveland unleashed an offensive barrage Thursday while also dominating on the glass. The Cavs put up a robust 24 shots from beyond the arc, draining 11 of them. They also shot a superb 56 percent from the field overall while nearly doubling up the Bucks on rebounds, 43 to 22. After building a dominating 63 - 48 halftime lead, the Cavs withstood a particularly strong third period from the Bucks and pulled away late to seal the victory. Milwaukee's Giannis Antetotkoumpo is apparently one of the few players in the NBA who does n't necessarily mind a dose of LeBron James defense. The Greek Freak had posted a 16 - point, 12 - rebound double - double in last Saturday's double - overtime showdown, and poured in a season - high 33 points on eye - popping 80 percent shooting from the field (12 - for - 15) Thursday. The Bucks also received double - digit performances from all but one of the rest of their starting five, as point guard Michael Carter-Williams finished with a nine - point tally on the night. Jabari Parker had a solid return from a foot injury with 14 points, three rebounds, and an assist, while Greg Monroe (17 points) and Khris Middleton (15 points) made significant contributions of their own. The Bucks fell to 5 - 7 and now reside in last place in the Eastern Conference's Central Division. They head to Indiana for a matchup versus the Pacers on Saturday. LeBron James and Kevin Love, as they have on several occasions already this season, led the way for the Cavs. James stuffed the stat sheet with 27 points, nine rebounds, and six assists, while Love enjoyed his matchup versus the Bucks' worst - ranked defense in points surrendered to power forwards, posting a huge double - double. Love amassed 24 points, hauled in 15 boards, and collected an assist, a steal, and a block. J.R. Smith managed a season - high 18 points, while Matthew Delladedova filled in admirably for late scratch Mo Williams (leg) by pitching in 13 assists to go along with seven points. Tristan Thompson paced the Cleveland bench with an efficient double - double of his own in 26 minutes, pouring in 12 points and collecting 11 rebounds. The Cavs improved to 9 - 3 and remain atop the Eastern Conference's Central Division. They remain home for a showdown on Saturday night versus the Hawks.

Redick capped off a wild fourth quarter with a fading buzzer beater from just inside the three point line. Chris Paul inbounded the ball with a pretty between the legs pass, as Redick came off a DeAndre Jordan screen, which sent Staples Center into a frenzy. The fourth quarter was a roller coaster for Los Angeles, as they went from letting the game slip away, to rallying behind an inspired Jamal Crawford. Prior to Redick’s bucket, Damian Lillard, in typical late game fashion, buried a contested step - back three to take a three point lead, but Crawford answered right back with a deep, high arcing trey to tie the game. Los Angeles looked gassed during most of the second half, and Portland had them playing ugly basketball, which they took advantage of throughout the third quarter. Jamal Crawford was pivotal down the stretch, and finished with 25 points on 3 - of - 6 shooting from deep in 33 minutes off the bench. Reddick added a 11 points in his starting role, but his lone three pointer came at the most needed moment of the game. Paul added 25 points, five rebounds and seven assists, but his biggest play of the game came on the possession before the game winner, where Paul played tremendous defense disallowing Lillard to get the ball when the Blazers needed him most. DeAndre Jordan completed a double - double with 12 points and 13 rebounds, while Paul Pierce went scoreless on five shots in his 14 minutes of action. Lillard lives for the fourth quarter, and almost sucked the life out of the Clippers when he hit the game tying three, but leading up to that point, he came close to shooting his team out of contention. The Portland point guard finished with 18 points on 4 - of - 16 shooting. The absence of Meyers Leonard (shoulder), who received season ending shoulder surgery, proved to be troubling for coach Terry Stotts, as he had to heavily rely on his other bigs in moments where Leonard was growing accustomed to playing. Mason Plumlee saw increased playing time, and added 11 points and six rebounds, while C.J. McCollum scored 17 points on 6 - of - 12 shooting.

A 28 - point second quarter allowed the Sixers (0 - 3) to take a 57 - 43 lead into intermission, with their strong first half having been spearheaded by third - year players Dario Saric and Joel Embiid. Coming in to Tuesday, the latter had been primed for a bump in playing time, as fellow center Jahlil Okafor was given the night off to rest.

The second quarter is when it really fell apart for Los Angeles, as they allowed Toronto to drop 41 points, as they trailed by 21 headed into the half. The assist - to - turnover ratio was a huge difference, with Toronto recording 25 assists to 10 turnovers, while Los Angeles matched their turnovers and assists at 16 a piece. The Raptors shot 54 percent from the field, while the Lakers shot just 34 percent. Los Angeles (10 - 11) has been regressing over recent weeks and this was a tough task north of the border. The bench was the only thing keeping them around, as Jordan Clarkson and Lou Williams both scored in double figures yet again. They did struggle shooting though, as Williams went 4 - of - 14 on his way to 13 points and Clarkson went 4 - of - 15 for 14 points. Brandon Ingram was the lone starter in double figures, as he totaled 17 points and six rebounds in the defeat. Julius Randle finished with eight points and eight rebounds in just 22 minutes. The Lakers will have to play again on Saturday, as they face the Memphis Grizzlies on the road. Toronto (13 - 6) has now won five - straight games and are scoring at will. In fact, they are averaging just shy of 120 points a game in that span. The Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan duo once again carried the load. Lowry tallied 24 points, four rebounds and seven assists, while DeRozan finished with 16 points, four rebounds and six assists. Norman Powell started for DeMarre Carroll and accrued 16 points and seven rebounds as a nice fill - in small forward. Cory Joseph and Lucas Nogueira combined for 27 points on 12 - of - 15 shooting off the bench. Toronto will remain at home, as they host the struggling Atlanta Hawks on Saturday.

Their fatigue also was reflected in their 16 turnovers, and their overall sluggish performance. Allen's 15 points paced the Memphis starting five, and he added nine rebounds and two steals. Lance Stephenson was the overall team leader on offense for the second straight night, posting 18 points, eight rebounds and six assists over 30 minutes. The newly - signed Ray McCallum acquitted himself well in his first game with the Grizzlies, totaling 13 points, four rebounds, two assists, two steals and a block.

The Sixers have shown marked improvement over the last several weeks, as seven wins qualify as such when a team starts the season 0 - 18. However, coming off an impressive victory over a depleted Suns team at home Tuesday, Philadelphia ran into much stiffer competition in the form of the Pistons' top 10 defense. Detroit elicited 17 turnovers from the visitors, which led to 24 points. In contast, a night earlier, the Sixers had taken the ball 17 times themselves from the Suns, which they'd converted to 28 points. Despite the loss, Philadelphia's re - shuffled frontcourt was very productive, with Jerami Grant and Nerlens Noel turning in notable efforts. The pair tallied 21 and 20 points, respectively, helping make up for the absence of Jahlil Okafor (illness). Grant added eight rebounds, two assists, three steals and a block to his team - high scoring total, while Noel also hauled in seven boards, four assists, a steal and a block. Ish Smith was the only other starter with double - digit scoring, totaling 13 points and dishing out six assists, hauling in three boards and posting a block. Robert Covington turned in a modest but productive outing with eight points and eight rebounds. Hollis Thompson paced the Sixers bench with 12 points, two rebounds and an assist. The Sixers remain firmly entrenched in last place in the Eastern Conference's Atlantic Division. They head back home to await the Golden State Warriors for a Saturday afternoon tilt. Detroit received a pair of 20 - point - plus efforts from two of their most dependable stars, Andre Drummond and Reggie Jackson. The latter contributed a team - high 27 points, and added three assists, a pair of rebounds and a steal. Meanwhile, Drummond put together one of his trademark double - doubles, slamming home 25 points and grabbing 18 boards. He also added a pair of steals and a block. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope poured in 14 points and added four rebounds, a steal and a block. Marcus Morris was the fourth starter with double - digit scoring, totaling 10 points, seven rebounds and a trio of dimes. However, it was his backup, rookie Stanley Johnson, who outplayed him while also pacing the reserves with 18 points, three rebounds, three assists and a steal.

That made Lillards play even more dire. However, the Trail Blazers got huge production from their bench, as Meyers Leonard and C.J. McCollum played huge roles in forcing Game 5.

McCollum hit both of his three - point attempts ended the game with 18 vital points to go along with five rebounds and two steals. The Trail Blazers will try and keep their season alive in Game 5, with hopes of forcing a Game 6 in Portland.

Mike Conley\\'s absence was very apparent, as Lillard was able to get what he wanted, especially in the second half. In a somewhat questionable decision, Jon Leuer entered the game in the fourth quarter and the Grizzlies gave up six points in what may have been the turning point in the game.

In a battle of Western Conference hopefuls, this was a beautiful game at times and an ugly game at others. Both teams fought throughout and played some great offense, but the hack - a - Jordan strategy ruined it's luster at times. The strategy worked though, as it ruined the Clippers momentum in the fourth quarter en route to a 5 - for - 18, 19 - point quarter. The Spurs started the fourth on an 110 run and that proved to be the difference. The Clippers have nothing to be disappointed about, as they played a great game against an elite defense. They did fall just short, but a game like this can give them some momentum going forward. All the Clippers stars played well, as Blake Griffin and Chris Paul combined for 52 points and 10 assists. DeAndre Jordan put in a 16 point - 17 rebound game, but did shoot 8 - for - 20 from the free - throw line, thanks to the hack - a - Jordan strategy. Putting up 107 points against this defense is an impressive feat though, win or loss. The Clippers will play the Houston Rockets in their next game on Saturday in a playoff revenge game. The Spurs are now 150 at home and playing some of the best basketball in the NBA. Their defense has been carrying them this season, but it was subpar tonight. They did turn on the defense in the fourth quarter though and that's when it truly matters. The three - point shooting was spectacular for San Antonio tonight, as they went 10 - for - 19 from long distance.

Despite out - scoring the Wizards 36 - 26, marked by a big late quarter run, the Rockets just ran out of time and were n\\'t able to complete the comeback to get the victory in front of their home fans. Free throws may have been the difference in this one, with the Wizards converting on 26 - of - 28, while the Rockets only hit 14 - of - 23 from the line. The Wizards victory was largely the result of an outstanding performance from Bradley Beal. Beal went 9 - for - 17 from the field and 5 - for - 11 from the three - point line to score a season - high of 33 points. He was able to get to the line at will, converting on a perfect 10 - of - 10 on his free throws. It was a nice breakout performance for him, as he\\'s averaged 15 points thus far this season. Another solid contributor was Paul Pierce who had an efficient 21 points, where he went 7 - for - 9 from the floor and 6 - for - 6 from the free throw line. He\\'s bumped up his scoring the last few games, combining for 38 points over that span. John Wall did n\\'t have his best shooting performance (4 - 10 FG, 0 - 1 3Pt), but he still finished with 13 points and was able to add 12 assists, giving him a double - double.

Per usual, the 23 - year - old superstar did everything on the court, including going a perfect 8 - of - 8 from the line. Free-throw shooting was a major edge for the Pelicans, as they reached the line 35 times and shot 80 percent. It took an edge at the line and holding Phoenix to just 43 percent shooting to squeeze out the win, as the Suns managed to come away with an impressive 13 offensive rebounds for second chances. Phoenix (17 - 39) also saw an extremely strong game from point guard Eric Bledsoe. Bledsoe scored a team - high 37 points and came away with three steals. Bledsoe, who had his season shortened by a torn meniscus in 2015 - 16, has been enjoying the best year of his career thus far.

Boston snapped their four - game losing streak with the win. Despite tweaking his ankle near the end of their last game Saturday, Jared Sullinger led the way with 20 points and 11 rebounds in 27 minutes. This game got out of reach for the Kings early enough that both teams used most of their benches for significant stretches. The Celtics gained their biggest advantage on defense, holding the Kings to 37 percent shooting from the field while also forcing them into giving up 22 points off 16 turnovers. Evan Turner started at point guard instead of Marcus Smart, who had started the last few games. Turner posted a double - double of 10 points and 11 assists, and Smart played well off the bench, putting up 11 points and six rebounds in 28 minutes. Boston will try to keep the good times rolling when they host the Dallas Mavericks and welcome back Rajon Rondo for his first game in TD Garden as a member of the Mavericks. Sacramento has lost four of their last five games, and their poor performance Wednesday feels like a new low for the mercurial franchise. Jason Thompson started every single game this season coming into Wednesday, but he was moved to the bench in favor of Ryan Hollins and never entered the game. It was believed Thompson might be one of the pieces to fall out of the rotation after the Kings made a coaching change a couple weeks back, but coach Ty Corbin has been slow to make changes, leaving the Kings players questioning what exactly the direction of the team is. They’ll continue their road trip against the Minnesota Timberwolves on Thursday, giving them a quick turnaround and a new opportunity to get moving in the right direction.

Knowing that they had just one game standing between themselves and history, the Warriors came out on Tuesday and showed why they were the league\\'s best team this season. The Warriors took over in the second half, and although they never built a massive lead, they played so well on both ends of the floor that even a ten point lead seemed insurmountable for the Cavaliers. It was n\\'t necessarily Golden State\\'s \"Splash Brothers\" that made the biggest impact in the decisive Game 6, either. Andre Iguodala had his highest scoring total of the season with 25 points and also added five assists. He had averaged 10 points per game in the playoffs leading into Game 6. Iguodala\\'s tremendous play on both ends of the floor earned him Finals MVP honors despite not making a single start in the regular season. Draymond Green, who had struggled early in the series, posted a triple - double with 16 points, 11 rebounds, and 10 assists. Cleveland would not go down with out a fight, however. The Cavaliers chipped away at a 13 - point deficit with just under two minutes left to cut the Warriors\\' lead to just four points with 33 seconds remaining. In the end, the Warriors would not be denied the championship they had fought so hard to capture. The Warriors\\' championship cements their place among the best single seasons that the league has seen as they proved that a jump shooting team could be about more than just finesse. Golden State\\'s lock - down defense throughout the season was equal to its offensive fire power, which made this team one of the most unique and impressive champions in recent memory. For Cleveland, the season ends in disappointment, but it should be encouraged by the path that took the Cavaliers to Game 6 of the NBA Finals. A first - year NBA coach in David Blatt, a largely playoff - inexperienced roster, and a rash of injuries could have derailed a lesser team, but the Cavaliers battled until the bitter end. LeBron James\\' performance in the Finals nearly negated all of the injuries and bad luck that the Cavaliers endured during the postseason. James had 32 points and 18 rebounds over 47 minutes in Game 6. He had at least 30 points in five of the six games in this series and also posted two triple - doubles. James\\' Herculean efforts were n\\'t enough to knock off the full - strength Warriors, however. Still, James and the Cavaliers should be commended for their tremendous playoff run. The Cavaliers will undoubtedly be back in contention next season with a battle tested and talented roster. Golden State reached the pinnacle of basketball on Tuesday after many difficult and disappointing seasons. The Warriors began to look like a championship caliber team last season by finishing 20 games above .500 for the first time since the 1991 - 92 season. The addition of Steve Kerr as the coach this season vaulted the Warriors from contender to powerhouse, winning 67 regular season games to secure the top seed in the Western Conference. The Warriors had the best record in the NBA this season, the MVP of the league in Stephen Curry, and one of the best all - around teams in years. Golden State\\'s first title in 40 years will be one to remember, and its star - studded nucleus means that the Warriors will be formidable for years to come.

This was a tough situation for Cleveland and the effort - filled loss is still a good sign for the morale of this team. They'll get a few days off and then play the Detroit Pistons on Tuesday. The Bucks carried a two - game losing streak coming into this game and put in quite the effort against the defending Eastern Conference champs. In the Bucks five wins this season, they have allowed under 90 points per game on average and that defense held true tonight. The 105 points looks like a lot from Cleveland, but its an unfair indicator considering the Cavs scored 88 points going into overtime. Milwaukee was led by Greg Monroe, who totaled 16 points and 17 rebounds, while grabbing a game - capping offensive rebound in the final seconds. This is a young and exciting team and they should be a threat to any team on any given night. They'll look to start a new winning - streak on Tuesday against the Washington Wizards.

Golden State saved its best for the best competition with its best shooting performance of the year. The Warriors shot a remarkable 60% from the floor on their way to putting up 122 points against the Trail Blazers, who were missing LaMarcus Aldridge and Nicolas Batum. This matchup showcased two of the best point guards in the game with Steph Curry putting up 33 points while Damian Lillard finished with 29. The Warriors broke the game open in the third quarter with a 21 - 3 run, leading to a 36 point quarter. The Trail Blazers and Warriors will wrap up the season series on April 9 at the Oracle Arena. Just one night after dismantling the East\\'s fifth - best team, the Wizards, the Warriors put on a show against the West\\'s fourth seed. Golden State had n\\'t won a division title since the 1975 - 76 season where it lost in the conference finals. They are now one win shy of tying the franchise record for wins, a mark they should easily top. The Warriors dished out 37 assists in the game and scored 52 points in the paint. Golden State will return to action Friday when it hosts Memphis. Portland has started to slide over the past week with five straight losses. LaMarcus Aldridge, Nicolas Batum, and Chris Kaman were all sidelined with injuries, which forced Portland to reach deep into its bench with players like C.J McCollum and Joel Freeland both playing more than 20 minutes.

The Magic (9 - 12) embarked on their current road trip as losers of four in a row, and appeared like a team in disarray all the way around. However, they\\'ve found a way to turn things around away from the confines of Amway Center, as they\\'ve now managed to rattle off victories in four of their last five games, including three straight. Serge Ibaka played a pivotal role in Sunday\\'s win, as he posted a team - high 21 points and added seven rebounds, four assists, four blocks and three steals. The performance was an extension of a resurgent stretch by the veteran forward, one in which he\\'s posted double - digit scoring efforts in nine of 10 games and multiple blocks in seven of his last nine. Orlando has also developed a strong second unit in the the last several contests, with Nikola Vucevic and Jeff Green providing starter - quality production in reserve roles. Sunday, the pair posted 16 and 14 points, respectively, and the bench accounted for 45 of the Magic\\'s 98 points. D.J. Augustin logged another start in place of Elfrid Payton and was second to Ibaka on the starting five with 12 points, three rebounds and three assists. Aaron Gordon was next, supplying 10 points and three rebounds. Evan Fournier underwhelmed, however, registering just five points on 1 - of - 7 shooting, along with two assists, a rebound and three steals. Vucevic added eight rebounds, two assists and two blocks to his bench - leading scoring total, while Green supplemented his aforementioned 14 points with five rebounds and three assists. Detroit (11 - 11) actually received a balanced effort from their starting five, which was led by Marcus Morris\\' 21 points. He added five rebounds, an assist and a pair of steals. Reggie Jackson made his season debut and looked outstanding, collecting 18 points, four assists and a rebound over just 23 minutes while proving that his troublesome knee was in playing shape. Tobias Harris was able to provide 11 points, four rebounds and an assist against his former Magic teammates. Andre Drummond posted a 10 - point, 10 - rebound double - double that also included three assists, three steals and two blocks. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope cooled off from recent performances with a tally of nine points, nine rebounds, four assists and a steal. Ish Smith, who went back to the bench with Jackson\\'s return, managed 11 points, two assists and a rebound while leading the second unit in scoring.

The Wizards put forth a true team effort in toppling the Bucks, with four starters and one reserve all tallying double - digit scoring. Washington played its third consecutive game without standout shooting guard Bradley Beal (shoulder), but benefited from a second straight productive performance from his replacement, Garrett Temple (10 points, two rebounds, two assists, and two steals). Washington took its game to another level in the second quarter and never looked back, outscoring Milwaukee 37 - 17 after the Bucks opened the period leading 29 - 27. In their first game following a rousing double - overtime victory over Cleveland on Saturday, the Bucks could not generate much offense against a tough Wizards squad. Khris Middleton led Milwaukee with 14 points, a pair of rebounds, and a steal, while Jerryd Bayless pitched in across the stat sheet over a team - high 37 minutes on the floor. The eight - year veteran poured in 13 points, and added six rebounds, three assists, and two steals. He also drained another three buckets from beyond the arc, giving him nine three - pointers over the last three contests.

Greg Monroe endured his worst game in a Bucks uniform to date, amassing only four points, five rebounds, and four assists over 26 minutes. Greivis Vasquez and John Henson led Milwaukee’s reserves with 12 and 10 points, respectively. The Bucks dropped to 5 - 6 and are currently in last place in the Eastern Conference’s Central Division. They head to Cleveland for a matchup versus the Cavaliers on Thursday. For Washington, John Wall and Otto Porter also pitched in 19 points apiece, with the former coming just one assist short of a second consecutive double - double. Marcin Gortat contributed 12 points and nine rebounds, while Kris Humphries was the only member of the starting five in single digits with nine points. Jared Dudley paced the Wizards’ bench with a 13 - point performance against his former team, while veteran Gary Neal helped supplement Temple’s efforts at the shooting guard spot with 10 points of his own.

These are two teams on the outside looking in for the playoffs and the Mavericks were able to escape with a huge win to get them closer to that eight - seed. Despite New Orleans leading by six points after the first quarter, Dallas took care of business from there by winning the other three quarters by at least four points. In fact, the Mavericks outscored the Pelicans, 49 - 34, in the second half. Defense was key, as they held New Orleans to 40 percent from the field and 21 percent from three - point range, while forcing 19 turnovers. The Pelicans (23 - 36) now have two double - digit losses since acquiring DeMarcus Cousins and the growing pains are slower than most anticipated. Anthony Davis stepped up though, as he led the team with 39 points and 14 rebounds. Cousins finished with just 12 points, but provided 15 rebounds, six assists and three steals. Jrue Holiday was the only other Pelican in double figures, as he collected 18 points, seven rebounds and six assists. The other six players combined for just 14 points, nine rebounds, nine assists and no blocks. The Mavericks (23 - 35) have been surging since a terrible start and a win over a growing team like the Pelicans is just what they need to get some momentum going. Harrison Barnes led the way, as he tallied 19 points, three rebounds and three steals. Dirk Nowitzki finished second on the team, totaling 18 points and nine rebounds. Seth Curry and Yogi Ferrell combined for 20 points, 12 rebounds and 15 assists as the starting backcourt. Nerlens Noel made his debut and amassed nine points and 10 rebounds off the bench. Salah Mejri had a historically bad game, as he fouled out in five minutes, while failing to record a single stat aside from a turnover. Table format: There are two tables.

       "  'input': 'Input text: The Indiana Pacers (35 - 43) defeated the New York Knicks (15 - 63) 102 - 86 on Wednesday at Madison Square Garden in New York. The Pacers picked up a very big win in this one, as they\\'re in a fight for the eighth and final projected playoff seed in the Eastern Conference. The Nets remain in that eighth spot and own just a one game lead over the Pacers, so they\\'ll need to come out victorious in the majority of their final four games of the regular season if they want to play in the postseason. Despite turning the ball over 17 times compared to just 11 from the Knicks, the Pacers made up for it with their rebounding, as they posted a 54 - 34 advantage. As he\\'s done for the majority of the time that he\\'s been healthy, George Hill was the player that led this team to the win. He went 7 - for - 11 from the field and 1 - for - 2 from the three - point line to score a game - high of 20 points, while also adding six rebounds and five assists. Hill was away from the team Tuesday for personal reasons, but he was able to come back for this one and pick up where he left off with another strong performance. Roy Hibbert notched a double - double in the win, finishing with 11 points (5 - 9 FG, 1 - 2 FT) and 11 rebounds over just 16 minutes. It was his first double - double over his last seven games, as the big man was able to have a bunch of success against a struggling Knicks\\' team. Both CJ Miles and David West finished in double figures as well in their run with the starters. West went a perfect 5 - of - 5 from the field to score 11 points, while Miles added 13 points (5 - 14 FG, 1 - 5 3Pt, 2 - 2 FT) and four rebounds as well. Langston Galloway and Andrea Bargnani were the few Knicks\\' players to have some success Wednesday. Galloway finished with 19 points (6 - 14 FG, 1 - 2 3Pt, 6 - 6 FT) and five rebounds, while Bargnani chipped in with 15 points (5 - 11 FG, 2 - 2 3Pt, 3 - 3 FT) and six rebounds. Galloway has shot under 40 percent from the field in five of his last six games prior to Wednesday, so he\\'ll likely look to try and establish more consistency in the final few games of the 2015 regular season. Bargnani has put in a couple of solid games in a row, combining for 40 points and 14 rebounds over his last two matchups. He\\'s now averaging 15 points and 4 rebounds on the season. Tim Hardaway JR, Quincy Acy and Jason Smith all added 12 points of their own off the bench. The Pacers\\' next game will be on the road against the Detroit Pistons on Friday, while the Knicks will be at home against the Milwaukee Bucks on Friday.

It was a second quarter in which Brooklyn allowed 33 points and scored just 20 of their own that very well may have decided this game. Miami shot 53 percent from the field and outrebounded the Nets 44 - 35 in the win. There were only 18 combined turnovers, so it was a well - played, clean game all - around. Dwyane Wade shot just 3 - for - 16 in his most previous game, but was spectacular here. He went 13 - for - 17 from the field to accumulate 28 points, five rebounds, two assists and three blocks in the win. When Wade is playing like this, the Heat are a hard team to beat. Hassan Whiteside had been struggling lately but had a nice game here, tallying 20 points and 13 rebounds. Goran Dragic also continued his recent good form, as he totaled 16 points, five assists, three rebounds and two steals in the victory. This four - headed monster of Wade, Whiteside, Dragic and Chris Bosh is a scary combo and they should be able to compete with anyone if all four are on their game. Miami will look to keep up the momentum when they host the Toronto Raptors on Friday in their next game. The Nets haven’t been as bad as their 7 - 18 record would indicate and they just ca n\\'t seem to close games out late. They played poor defense here as well, as they allowed 53 percent shooting and drew just 12 turnovers in the loss. Brook Lopez led the team with 25 points, but Jarrett Jack was the best player on Wednesday. Jack tallied 22 points and 10 assists and continues to show that he\\'s a legitimate starting point guard in this league.

In an anticipated blowout, the Bucks kept this game with an unlikely recipe. Milwaukee came into this game as the worst rebounding team in the NBA and actually outrebounded the Thunder, who rank second in the NBA in rebounding. The game was played at an incredible fast pace, as the 24 - second shot clock didn’t even need to be on. The difference in the game was the free - throw shooting, as the Thunder went 37 - for - 40 from the charity stripe, while the Bucks went just 15 - for - 22. Milwaukee came into this game as a huge underdog, but held their own to keep it close throughout. This was one of the best offensive performances that the Bucks have had all season and it\\'s a shame they couldn’t keep the Thunder off the free - throw line. Khris Middleton has been fantastic lately and that form continued here, as he scored a career - high 36 points in the loss. Michael Carter-Williams also played well, as he tallied 19 points, nine assists and nine rebounds in the defeat. This goes down as a loss, but Milwaukee did some good things here that they can definitely build upon for future endeavors. The Bucks next game will be on Thursday against the Pacers in Indiana. Oklahoma City has been the second - best offense in the NBA this season and they improved on that scoring average tonight. Per usual, Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant were the stars of the show and put up very similar lines. In fact, Westbrook totaled 27 points, seven rebounds, seven assists and five steals, while Durant amassed 26 points, six rebounds and eight assists. Those two also went a combined 20 - for - 21 from the free - throw line and continue to carry this team. Cameron Payne also had his best game as a pro, as he scored a career - high 16 points off the bench in just 16 minutes. The bench was good all - around, as they scored 53 points in the win. If the bench can score 40 - plus regularly with Durant and Westbrook doing what they do, this team will be impossible to beat.

Veteran Al Jefferson had been relatively quiet on the offensive front over his first four games, scoring no higher than 17 points in any of those contests. The Hornets center exploded Thursday for his highest scoring output in almost a full year, coming within three points of the 34 he’d posted Nov. 7, 2014 versus the Hawks. The most eye - popping statistic from Jefferson’s stellar night was undoubtedly his accuracy from the field, with Big Al draining buckets at a blistering 83 percent clip (15 - of - 18). The Hornets were also the beneficiaries of Marvin Williams’ third double - double in five games, and Kemba Walker’s 14 - point effort. Jeremy Lamb followed up a strong 20 - point performance in Tuesday’s blowout of the Bulls by posting a second consecutive double - digit scoring night to pace Charlotte’s reserves. Cody Zeller pitched in a season - high 11 points over a highly efficient 19 minutes on the floor. The Hornets improve to 2 - 3 and are in third place in the Eastern Conference’s Southeast Division. Charlotte heads to San Antonio for what should be a tough Saturday tilt versus the Spurs. The Mavs enjoyed fairly solid shooting nights from four of their starting five, who all scored in double digits. Zaza Pachulia, looking like a strong offseason acquisition, posted his third double - double of the year and second in the last three contests. However, Raymond Felton, drawing the start at shooting guard, could only muster seven points. Dwight Powell was able to lead the Dallas bench with a 14 - point contribution. The Mavs fall to 2 - 3 and reside in second place in the Western Conference’s Southwest Division. They remain home for a date with the New Orleans Pelicans on Saturday.

Dallas cut Portland\\'s lead to 10 with just over four minutes to go in the fourth but did not register another point as the Trail Blazers pulled away en route to an easy victory. However, the bigger story for Portland on Thursday night was Wesley Matthews, who went down with a left foot injury. Matthews reportedly went in for an MRI shortly after exiting the game in the third. If Matthews\\' injury turns out to be serious, Portland will be missing its best three point shooter. Dallas came into the game on two days rest, but had a rough night from the floor. The Mavericks were held to 37 percent from the field and went just 2 - for - 16 from beyond the arc. Tyson Chandler returned from a three - game absence and finished with four points and 14 rebounds over 28 minutes. The Mavericks have another tough game on the docket as they will travel to the Oracle Arena to take on the Warriors on Friday. Portland was playing its second game in as many nights after grinding out an overtime victory in Los Angeles against the Clippers on Wednesday. Nicolas Batum turned in another big performance with 15 points and 12 rebounds in 36 minutes on the floor.

Two of the toughest competitors have bested the Spurs over the past week, as the Cleveland Cavaliers joined the Golden State Warriors in defeating Gregg Popovich and his basketball machine. The Spurs were once again without Tim Duncan (knee), who should return to the lineup on Tuesday, and the effects are beginning to take notice. Before the injury, Duncan was leading the league in defensive efficiency and his passing ability has always been a staple to the Spurs game. David West got the nod in Duncan’s absence, but is far from as efficient to the five time champions. West finished with eight points, three rebounds and one assist in 23 minutes. Kawhi Leonard led San Antonio in scoring and contributed 24 points, six rebounds and two assists on 7 - of - 15 shooting. LaMarcus Aldridge was efficient in the effort, scoring 15 points on 11 shots, but was almost invisible in the rebounding battle, as he grabbed a lowly two boards. The Spurs will host the Orlando Magic (20 - 25) on Monday. Cleveland was able to exploit the Duncan-less smallball lineup and earned strong performances from all five starters, who finished in double figures. LeBron James was unstoppable on the drive, and more impressive chasing down Manu Ginobili in transition. James finished with a game high 29 points, five rebounds, seven assists and two blocks (both on Ginobili) on 10 - of - 17 shooting in 34 minutes. Kevin Love put together one of his best games of the season, scoring 21 points, to go along with 11 rebounds and three assists on 8 - of - 13 shooting, while Kyrie Irving was the third Cavs member to score 20 - plus points.

These are two of the fastest - paced teams in the NBA right now and it made for a fun game to watch. The difference in this game was as simple as shooting, as the Pacers really struggled from three - point range and from the free - throw line. In fact, they went just 3 - for - 17 from long distance and 11 - for - 19 from the charity stripe through the first 44 minutes. Golden State also turned it on in the final 12 minutes, as they shot over 60 percent from the field in the fourth quarter. Steve Kerr made his return to coaching here for the Warriors and they were obviously happy to get him a win in his first game back after dealing with migraines from back surgery for the first half of the year. The Pacers actually did a great job of hanging around in this game, but didn’t execute enough to pull out a big win. Not only did they shoot poorly, they also had far too many defensive breakdowns against this potent Warriors offense. The bench is what kept Indiana in the game, as they got 60 points and 26 rebounds from just five players with rookies Joe Young and Myles Turner leading the bunch. Turner scored a career - high 31 points while also snatching down eight boards with Young amassing 16 points and eight assists. Monta Ellis scored all of his 18 points in the second half after playing just five minutes in the first half because of foul trouble. If he were to play a full complement of minutes here, this result very well may have been different with how well he was playing. Paul George had one of his worst games of the year, as he tallied 12 points, two rebounds and one assist while dealing with foul trouble of his own. Indiana will have to hop on a plane just hours after this game to get ready for a matchup with the Sacramento Kings on Saturday. Steph Curry has had a great season, but he was just majestic on Friday. Curry accumulated 39 points, 10 rebounds and 12 assists en route to his seventh triple - double of his career. Draymond Green also played well, as he grabbed 22 points, 11 rebounds and four steals while shutting down George on the other end. The Warriors played great team - ball, as they dished out 30 - plus assists for the 22nd time this season, which is easily tops in the league. Golden State has had one of the easiest schedules in the NBA this season thus far and they face their biggest test in their next game, as the Warriors take on the San Antonio Spurs on Monday, who are in the midst of a 13 - game winning streak and a franchise - best start.

Defense in the second half was key for Detroit, as they held Miami to just 32 points in that 24 - minute stretch. Rebounding was the biggest factor in Detroit's win, as they won that battle, 48 - 34. They also dominated scoring down low as well, as they outscored the Heat, 42 - 26 in the paint. The Pistons (16 - 20) have been in a terrible rut recently, but this is a big road win to get them closer to .500. Reggie Jackson had his best game of the season, as he led the team with 27 points, two rebounds and four assists. Andre Drummond was equally as good, as he totaled 25 points, 18 rebounds and two blocks.

Superstar Paul George hit half his shots, going 6 - for - 12 en route to 19 points in 29 minutes. The forward tacked on four rebounds and six assists. Center Ian Mahinmi, meanwhile, had a respectable outing of 14 points and eight rebounds. Mahinmi has made a name for himself in the Pacers starting five this year, and is now high on many experts' lists for both Most Improved Player and Defensive Player of the Year contention. Another promising sign for Indiana heading into the playoffs was the strong play of bench guard Ty Lawson. Lawson, a borderline All-Star for much of his career in Denver, has seen a rocky 2015 - 16 season both on and off the court. The point guard has dealt with multiple DUI charges and had a disappointing stint in Houston before being cut, eventually landing himself in a Pacers uniform. The acquisition paid dividends for Indiana on Tuesday, as Lawson scored nine points and dished out eight assists in 24 minutes of play. The Knicks, meanwhile, became the first team to see its season end following Tuesday's loss. At 30 - 52, the Knicks will miss the playoffs for the third straight season.

Dragic led the way for Miami with a game - high 28 points to go along with four rebounds and four assists in 34 minutes, while Whiteside\\'s streak of 15 straight games with a double - double came to an end Tuesday, but just barely, as the big man finished with 17 points and nine rebounds in 30 minutes. Off the bench, James Johnson produced in a big way, making important plays down the stretch and recording 16 points and six rebounds in 33 minutes as a reserve. Most importantly, the Heat maintained their spot as the No. 8 seed in the Eastern Conference. As for the Pistons (34 - 41), their collapse results in them now being 3 games behind Miami for the last playoff spot, as they have now lost five games in a row. They were led Tuesday night by the heroics of Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, who led the team back after falling behind by double figures and finished with a team - high 25 points in 37 minutes. Ish Smith also came up big as the team\\'s starting point guard, scoring 16 points and dishing out six assists. Tobias Harris, in a return to a role off the bench, scored 19 points and grabbed six rebounds in 30 minutes. Up next, the Pistons will look to end their losing streak at home against Brooklyn on Thursday, while the Heat will head to New York on Wednesday to take on the Knicks.

DeMarcus Cousins led the way with a game - high 26 points and 13 rebounds. The Kings won the first three quarters and were up 59 - 44 at halftime. They turned the ball over just four times the entire game, taking away the Cavaliers' chances for easy points on offense. Cleveland has been active on the trade front, completing two separate deals in the last week to help improve their roster, but they've also seen their record worsen and are currently riding a five - game losing streak. LeBron James is nearing a return from his knee and back strains, which will give the team a talent boost, but talent has n't been their issue this season, consistency has. Playing in the Eastern Conference gives the Cavaliers a lot of time to find their footing, as they're in essentially no risk of missing the playoffs given the depths to the depravity in the East. At just .500, Cleveland is still the sixth seed. In the West, a .500 record would leave the Cavs on the outside looking in at the playoffs.

Prior to that, there were 12 lead changes and six ties, as it was close throughout the first half. Defense was key for the Bucks, as they held the Nets to 38 percent from the field and 30 percent from three - point range. Milwaukee also dominated the paint, winning the rebounding battle 48 - 40 and recording 10 blocks in their win. Milwaukee (9 - 8) has now won four of their last five and much of that success has to be attributed to the play of Giannis Antetokounmpo. The man known as the \"Greek Freak\" flirted with a triple - double in this win, accumulating 23 points, eight rebounds, eight assists and four steals in just 29 minutes of action. In fact, he sat out the entirety of the fourth quarter, as the game continued to get out of hand. Jabari Parker was second on the team with his 22 points on 8 - of - 14 shooting. John Henson started at center, totaling 12 points, eight rebounds and five blocks. Malcolm Brogdon had a nice game off the bench, tallying 13 points, four rebounds and four assists.

Boston was favored by a significant margin coming into this game and they showed why here. They really dominated the second and third quarters, as they outscored the Sixers by 10 points in each. The assist - to - turnover ratios were the huge difference in this game, as the Celtics outassisted the Sixers 29 to 17 and drew 23 Philly turnovers. Whenever you commit six more turnovers than assists, that\\'s an almost guaranteed loss. Philadelphia was also held to under 40 percent shooting with Boston hitting over 44 percent of their shots. Boston has been playing much better recently, as this was their fifth win in their last seven games. It was once again a team effort, as Isaiah Thomas and Jae Crowder tied the team - lead with 20 points scored. Marcus Smart came off the bench and gave the team a nice spark as well, as he scored 16 points and recorded four steals in the win. Jared Sullinger flirted with a triple - double too, as he tallied eight points, 11 rebounds and seven assists in the victory. Up next for the Celtics is the Washington Wizards, as they play Monday in the second portion of a back - to - back set. The Sixers have had very few of these types of games since the acquisition of Ish Smith, but this was simply an ugly loss. Committing 23 turnovers is a disastrous number and the game was well out of hand early in the fourth quarter. Robert Covington was the lone bright spot in the defeat, as he hit six three\\'s en route to a 25 - point, eight - rebound performance. No other player on the roster scored more than 12 points or grabbed double - digit rebounds. That\\'s a recipe for disaster and it\\'s even worse considering no one had more than four assists either.

He went 17 - for - 36 from the field and a ridiculous 11 - for - 19 from the three - point line to score a season - high of 55 points, while also adding four rebounds, five assists and two steals.

Irving is on an unbelievable stretch over his last two games, combining for 93 points, 11 assists and five steals. While Irving did most of it on his own, Kevin Love at least gave a little help, finishing with 10 points (3 - 15 FG, 2 - 8 3Pt, 2 - 2 FT) and 12 rebounds. He shot very poorly, but he still was able to record his fourth double - double in his last six games.

This was a bizarre game, but Denver took a 33 - 21 lead in the first quarter and never looked back after that. The free - throw shooting was pathetic from both teams, as Denver went 6 - for - 13, while the Suns went 11 - for - 17. This was Denver\\'s third time winning the second half of a back - to - back this season and that\\'s a good sign of resiliency for this young team. That snapped a three - game losing streak for Denver, which is a great sign with Oklahoma City, San Antonio and Cleveland next on the schedule. The Nuggets training staff is one of the busiest in the NBA right now and it\\'s amazing they pulled off a win here. They were missing Danilo Gallinari, Wilson Chandler, Jusuf Nurkic, Emmanuel Mudiay and Jameer Nelson in this game, yet still pulled it out. They went with an eight - man rotation and Randy Foye played one of the games of his career. Foye scored a season - high 31 points and dished out six assists. The bench was spectacular as well, as Will Barton, Nikola Jokic and Darrell Arthur combined for 49 points, 28 rebounds, 10 assists, three steals and two blocks in the victory. Those were the only three players to come off the bench and it was a hell of a coaching job by Mike Malone to manage everyones minutes. Denver\\'s next game will be a tough one though, as they take on a San Antonio Spurs who are undefeated at home this season. The Suns came into this game as nearly a double - digit favorite, but let down big time here. They let a shorthanded Nuggets team run them up and down the floor and they simply didn’t put in enough effort to win. Brandon Knight played well though, as he scored a team - high 21 points and handed out 10 assists. Ronnie Price also scored a career - high 20 points off the bench and was one of the only Suns playing good defense.

The key to a rather surprising double - digit victory Saturday was a departure from this trend, as Ian Mahinmi and George Hill managed matching 22 - point totals, marking the first time that either had eclipsed the 20 - point mark in the series. This made for a much more balanced scoring performance for the home squad, allowing them to knot the series up at two. The Raptors were led by Jonas Valanciunas\\' 16 points, six rebounds and a block. Kyle Lowry followed with 12 points, five assists, three rebounds and a steal. DeMarre Carroll matched Lowry\\'s point total and added six boards. One game after getting over the 20 - point mark for the first time in the series, DeMar DeRozan was back to single - digit scoring, collecting eight points, six rebounds, four assists and a steal. Patrick Patterson led the second unit with eight points, two assists, a rebound and a block. Mahinmi added ten rebounds, five assists, two steals and a block to his stat line, while Hill complemented his scoring total with four boards and three assists.

While both teams have already been eliminated from playoff contention, it was still another hard fought game Sunday. Both teams shot very similar percentages, with the Jazz going 46 percent from the field and 33 percent from the three - point line, while the Kings went 48 percent from the floor and 33 percent from deep. This marked the fifth straight loss for the Kings, as they look to improve their draft positioning for the 2015 NBA Draft. The Jazz got their biggest offensive contribution from Rodney Hood, who led this team to the close victory. The rookie finished with a team - high of 25 points (9 - 17 FG, 1 - 6 3Pt, 6 - 7 FT), to go along with four steals. He\\'s only averaging 8 points on the season, but he\\'s put together two impressive performances in a row, combining for 42 points and five steals. His four steals were also a career - high. While Gordon Hayward struggled to just five points (2 - 11 FG, 1 - 3 3Pt), it was Rudy Gobert and Derrick Favors who gave Hood the most help. Gobert finished with 10 points (5 - 7 FG), nine rebounds and two blocked shots, while Favors added 11 points (5 - 11 FG, 1 - 1 FT) and five rebounds of his own. Favors could have put up some higher numbers, but he was limited to just 16 minutes, as he was given a light work load due to the season wearing down and nothing much left to play for. Favors has averaged 16 points and 8 rebounds so far this season, both of which are the best numbers of his five - year career.

The four steals also matched a season - high for him. Cousins, on the other hand, posted a game - high of 26 points (11 - 22 FG, 4 - 9 FT), to go along with 12 rebounds and four assists. It marked his sixth double - double in a row, a stretch where he\\'s averaging an impressive 28 points and 17 rebounds.

In a surprising effort, the Sixers were able to come out victorious and end their drought. While they did n't necessarily have the best game shooting the ball, finishing at 35 percent from the field and 36 percent from the three - point line, they still shot better than the Wizards, who finished at just 32 percent from the field and a meager 24 percent from beyond the arc.

He's really started to get it going offensively, averaging 12 points per game over his last five.

It was a new season - high for the forward, as he received extended playing time with Paul Pierce sitting due to a knee injury.

The Knicks started the game with an explosive 42 point first quarter, and their dominance of the game only continued from there. Superstar Carmelo Anthony led the way for the Knicks, dropping in 28 points including five makes from beyond the three - point line. The Knicks as a whole looked strong from deep, shooting 44 percent from beyond the arc. Even more impressive, however, was their perimeter defense, as they held the Nets to just 3 - for - 11 from three - point range. Also impressing for the Knicks was power forward Kristaps Porzingis. The reigning Eastern Conference Rookie of the Month posted yet another double - double, scoring 19 points and pulling down 10 rebounds. Porzingis has been sensational thus far this season. Despite projecting as a project player, the Latvian forward is looking like a strong candidate for Rookie of the Year. For the Nets, meanwhile, the loss marked a dropoff in momentum after two straight wins. Brooklyn holds the unfortunate title of second - worst record in the Eastern Conference, a problem only confounded by the fact that Boston owns the rights to their draft pick this year. Despite solid play from the frontcourt tandem of Brook Lopez (21 points, four rebounds, two blocks) and Thaddeus Young (19 points, 11 rebounds), the Nets were simply unable to get anything going tonight, trailing by at least 15 points for the last three and a half quarters. The Knicks currently sit at eleventh in the Eastern Conference, trailing one and a half games behind the Celtics, Magic, and Hawks. New York will look to carry momentum from the strong showing against the Nets into their next matchup, a trip to Milwaukee on Saturday to face the Bucks.

The refrain is a familiar one for the Hornets (19 - 14), but does n't seem to get old: The dynamic duo of Kemba Walker and Nicolas Batum supply a significant portion of the offense, and the complementary pieces around them step up in support as needed. That formula equaled another home victory for Charlotte on Thursday, their 11th of the season in 17 home games. Walker scored a game - high 22 points, while Batum provided 16. The hosts also played superior team defense, holding the Heat (10 - 23) to 40 percent shooting overall and inducing 16 turnovers. Miami was paced by Josh Richardson, who followed up a 22 - point outing against the Thunder on Tuesday with another 20 points on Thursday, along with four rebounds, two assists, a block and a steal. Tyler Johnson came off the bench to supply 18 points, seven rebounds, five assists, two steals and a block. Wayne Ellington provided 12 points, two boards and an assist in a reserve role as well. The returning Goran Dragic could only muster five points on 2 - of - 11 shooting, although he did add eight assists, three rebounds and a steal. Hassan Whiteside went for eight points, 10 rebounds and two blocks, notably taking only seven shots on the night. Walker complemented his aforementioned scoring total with seven rebounds, four assists and a steal. Batum filled out the stat sheet with 13 rebounds, eight assists, three steals and a block.

Cody Zeller offered nine points, seven rebounds, two assists, a steal and a block, while Jeremy Lamb led the second unit with 10 points, eight rebounds and a block.

Regardless, the Celtics took advantage, picking up a huge victory as they fight to stay in the playoffs. Marcus Smart led the way scoring for Boston, posting 19 points on 7 - of - 10 shooting in 34 minutes. Avery Bradley was close behind, scoring 15 points (7 - 12 FG) in 31 minutes.

Cleveland proved it was up to the task in the second half of their back - to - back set, jumping on New Orleans early and then pulling away in the final period. The Cavaliers jumped out to a 28 - 20 lead after one quarter despite playing without starting power forward Kevin Love, who was nursing a bruised thigh. Although they trailed by as much as 15 in the second quarter, New Orleans battled back and closed the gap to four points on several occasions throughout the second half. However, Cleveland's stars turned it up a notch when they needed it most, as Lebron James and Kyrie Irving combined for 17 points in a final period that the Cavs won by a margin of 25 - 14. Three Cleveland starters - James, Irving and J.R. Smith - - turned in 20 - point - plus performances, and accounted for the bulk of the home team's scoring on the night. The Pelicans were led by Norris Cole's career - high 26 points, which he supplemented with five assists, two rebounds and a steal. His only blemish on the night was his five turnovers. Anthony Davis was the only other starter to tally double - digit scoring, scoring 24 points, and adding 11 rebounds and two blocks. Jrue Holiday paced the Pelicans bench with 12 points, five rebounds, four assists and a pair of steals.

Irving scored a game - high 29 points in spearheading Cleveland's attack. He also managed four rebounds, three assists and two steals, and has now scored over 20 points in four of his last five contests. James was right behind him with 27 points, eight assists, three rebounds and a steal. J.R. Smith was chucking all night along, uncorking 16 three - point attempts and scoring 20 points overall, along with four rebounds, three assists and a steal. Tristan Thompson, who got the starting nod in Love's stead, notably went scoreless over 33 minutes but was a force on the glass, hauling in 15 rebounds while also dishing out an assist.

The Lakers actually went on a 140 run after Anthony Davis suffered a back injury in the third, as the Pelicans let the game get away.

Hardaway finished with 33 points on 12 - of - 18 shooting from the field, and his performance ended up overshadowing the return to Houston for Dwight Howard, who put together his best performance of the season against his old team, recording 24 points and 23 rebounds in 37 minutes. For the Rockets, everything was going right for them through three quarters, and more importantly, everything was going right for James Harden, who had been going through a bit of a slump as of late. Harden finished with a game - high 41 points, eight rebounds, eight assists and four steals. Clint Capela also put together a nice game down low, scoring 22 points and grabbing nine boards in 31 minutes. Unfortunately for Houston, no lead was safe, and in the end, their poor shooting down the stretch cost them.

Russell Westbrook added his league - leading 16th triple - double of the season with 26 points (10 - 16 FG), 12 assists and 11 rebounds, the latter both representing game highs.

In a close game throughout, the Blazers simply made more plays late to close out a big road win. Denver allowed Portland to get too many easy baskets and it was clear they had some tired legs here in the back end of a back - to - back set. The Trail Blazers shot over 50 percent from the field and scored 32 points over the final 12 minutes to close things out. Nuggets power forward Kenneth Faried made a shocking start here, as he was carted off the court with what appeared to be a serious neck injury just the night before. Portland has now won four of their last five games, with all of those wins coming without Damian Lillard. C.J. McCollum continues to play at an All-Star level in his absence, as he tallied 25 points, seven assists and three rebounds in the win. Allen Crabbe and Al-Farouq Aminu provided 14 points a piece as well. Gerald Henderson was the hero off the bench, as he scored 19 points in just 24 minutes. Portland came into this game with a 6 - 15 record on the road, so a win like this can be a big momentum booster going forward in a tough environment like Denver. They have a tough task on Monday though, as they have to take on the Memphis Grizzlies in a back - to - back. Denver was coming off a grueling overtime loss to the Golden State Warriors on Saturday and it was clear they simply didn’t have their legs tonight in a back - to - back set. They really struggled in the fourth quarter and allowed way too many easy baskets in the closing minutes. This was Danilo Gallinari's second game back and he played great yet again, amassing 29 points, five rebounds and three assists in the loss. Jameer Nelson also had a nice game, as he contributed 17 points and seven assists. The godsend for this team all year has been Will Barton, but he really struggled tonight scoring just five points on 2 - for - 10 shooting. The Nuggets are now just 5 - 11 at home and that's a scary trend considering they used to have one of the best home advantages in the NBA in years past. Denver has now lost nine of their last 10 games and they'll look to break that slide on Wednesday against the Minnesota Timberwolves. Table format: There are two tables.

Cleveland seized control from the early going Thursday, but its road to victory got significantly easier when Dwayne Wade left the game midway through the second quarter. Wade slipped and took an awkward fall, suffering a bruised left knee that sidelined him for the remainder of the game. Cleveland allowed Miami to get as close as 10 points in the third before completely pulling away. LeBron James and Kyrie Irving each poured in 23 points to help notch the Cavaliers' 17th consecutive home win. Miami was already a banged up unit coming into Thursday's game, but losing Dwayne Wade for any amount of time could put its playoff chances in serious jeopardy. Thursday's loss drops Miami to the eighth spot in the East, with teams like Boston, Charlotte, and Indiana all within striking distance. Wade's injury occured to the same knee that he had drained last Saturday, leaving his status ahead of Saturday's game in Detroit in question. The Heat did have a key player return to the starting lineup Thursday with Hassan Whiteside getting the nod at center. Whiteside finished with 17 points and eight rebounds. The Heat have a couple games with major playoff implications on the horizon with matchups against the Pacers and Hornets following Saturday's game. Cleveland did n't have its full complement of players available for this game, but its reserves rose to the occasion. Kevin Love sat out with a sore back, but Tristan Thompson was a difference maker with his increased playing time. Thompson pulled down 15 rebounds to go with eight points and Iman Shumpert had one of his best games as a Cavalier, pouring in 17 points on 7 - of - 12 shooting.

The highlight of the night was the performance of emerging superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo, who led the Bucks with 32 points on 12 - of - 22 shooting. It was the rest of the Greek Freak's stat line that was especially impressive, though, as he pulled down 13 rebounds to go along with six assists, two steals, and a block while not turning the ball over once. Sacramento (27 - 44) has seen things turn fairly bleak after trading away star center DeMarcus Cousins. The team has won just two games in its last 11 contests and saw an embarrassing loss at home on Wednesday. Defensive lapses were the story for the Kings, as they allowed the Bucks to shoot a whopping 54 percent from the field and bury 16 three - pointers. Three-point shooting on Sacramento's end, meanwhile, has been a problem area. The Kings hit only nine three - pointers and have seen a sharp decline in both three - point makes and attempts since their deadline dealings. The Kings will play in Golden State on Friday, while Milwaukee will host the Atlanta Hawks.

The Hornets came in to the contest with a playoff spot in hand, while the Raptors were trying to keep their faint chances of catching the top - seeded Cleveland Cavaliers alive. Charlotte, which had won five of their last seven games, and five of their last seven road contests as well, gave Toronto all they could handle until the closing seconds after mounting a furious rally in the fourth quarter. The vistors had entered the final 12 minutes trailing 75 - 59, but a strong effort by Jeremy Lin, who started for the injured Nicolas Batum (knee), helped key the comeback. The Hornets got as close as 93 - 88 with 37 seconds remaining after Kemba Walker successfully converted an and - one, but DeMar DeRozan and Corey Joseph were able to sink two key free throws apiece to seal the win.

The Hawks got off to a torrid start, shooting 64 percent in the first half on their way to putting up 66 points through the first 24 minutes.

Charlotte entered Oracle Arena with an above .500 record as part of an impressive start to the 2015 - 2016 season. While the game was never as close as the final score came out to be, the Hornets played well as a unit and moved the ball fluidly against the league’s best team. Kemba Walker, who has been on a tear over the last week, including two 30 - plus point performances, contributed 22 points, seven rebounds and three assists on 9 - of - 21 shooting. Most notably, Walker is finishing over 50 percent in the paint, a trend that many analysts are highlighting Stephen Curry for improving during the offseason as well. The UCONN product’s touch in the lane is up 10 percent from last season, and is a great sign for the point guard moving forward. The Hornets also look to Jeremy Lamb, who came over from Oklahoma City during the offseason, and matched Walker’s 22 points in 29 minutes off the bench. The loss of Al Jefferson for a reported six weeks is a major blow to the frontcourt, and Marvin Williams and Cody Zeller combo was only good eight points and 16 boards. Shooting 44 percent as a unit will likely get you a competitive game with solid chance at a win, but the Warriors completed 52 percent of their shots, which almost always will result in a loss for the opposition.

While its record in that span may not jump off the page, the emergence of its young players has been encouraging. Michael Carter-Williams had his third triple - double of the season Friday, putting up 17 points, 10 rebounds, and 10 assists. Carter-Williams is now tied with Rajon Rondo for the league lead in triple - doubles. In addition, the 76ers had 16 fast break points, compared to just five such points for the Timberwolves. Minnesota was unable to close the gap late with some poor shooting and a poor defensive effort. There were some bright spots for the Timberwolves, however. Kevin Martin, in his second game back from a wrist injury, had 19 points and five assists in 30 minutes off the bench. Nikola Pekovic looked strong as well, putting up 18 points and seven rebounds. The Timberwolves will play the second half of a back - to - back set Saturday when they host the Cavaliers. Philadelphia scored over 100 points for the first time since a Dec. 13 overtime loss to Memphis. Nerlens Noel continued to be a defensive force Friday, recording six blocks to go along with 14 points and six rebounds.

Coming off the bench, Chase Budinger added 15 points (4 - 13 FG, 4 - 8 3Pt, 3 - 3 FT) and five assists, while Sean Kilpatrick added a career - high of 13 points (4 - 7 FG, 3 - 4 3Pt, 2 - 2 FT) in just his second NBA regular season game ever. With Gordon Hayward out due to a collarbone injury, Derrick Favors and Rudy Gobert did everything they could to keep the Jazz afloat. Each recorded a double - double, as Favors posted 19 points (8 - 13 FG, 3 - 7 FT) and 12 rebounds, while Gobert had 18 points (7 - 11 FG, 4 - 8 FT), 17 rebounds and six blocked shots. Favors has posted two double - doubles in a row now, combining for 40 points and 23 rebounds during that span. Starting for Hayward, Joe Ingles made the most of the start, going 7 - for - 10 from the field and 4 - for - 6 from the three - point line to score 18 points. It was a season - high in points for Ingles, who's only reached double - digit points in 10 games this season. Trey Burke really struggled with his shot off the bench, but still chipped in with 16 points (4 - 22 FG, 2 - 13 3Pt, 6 - 6 FT), six assists and four steals in 38 minutes. The Jazz's next game will be at home against the Portland Trail Blazers on Wednesday, while the Timberwolves will be at home against the Los Angeles Lakers on Wednesday.

Notching their third victory in a row, the Hawks were able to hold off a fourth quarter comeback attempt from the Jazz. The Hawks were the superior shooters in this one, going 41 percent from the field compared to the Jazz who went just 37 percent. Free throws were also a factor, as Atlanta went 26 - for - 30 from the line, while Utah went 18 - for - 24 from the line. With the superior shooting and the free throw advantage, the Hawks were able to secure a cross - conference road victory. The Hawks were led by Jeff Teague in this one. Teague went 9 - for - 17 from the field and 2 - for - 4 from the three - point line to finish with 26 points and eight assists. Over his last three outings, he\\'s now averaging 25 points and 9 assists per game as the unquestioned offensive leader of this team. Paul Millsap also had a productive game despite going only 2 - for - 11 from the field. He scored 15 points, but most of it came from the free throw line where he went a perfect 10 - of - 10 on the night. Along with the 15 points, he added 11 rebounds, giving him his eigth double - double of the year. The other two Hawks to reach double figures in points were Al Horford and DeMarre Carroll, as they finished with 13 and 10 points respectively. Gordon Hayward had the biggest day for the Jazz.

He had a career - high of 13 points (5 - 9 FG, 3 - 7 3Pt), while also chipping in two rebounds two assists and another career - high of three steals. He\\'s only reached double figures in points four other times this season, so it was somewhat of a surprise performance. Enes Kanter and Rudy Gobert had 11 points each.

The Clippers, after getting off to a rocky start, have now won seven of their last nine games, and are quickly establishing position in the Western Conference playoff picture. All-Star power forward Blake Griffin once again came up big for the Clippers, tying for the team lead in points with 21 and also pulling down nine rebounds. With point guard Chris Paul having a slightly substandard year, largely due to being hampered by nagging injuries, Griffin has many saying that he has emerged as the face of the franchise. The superstar had a career year in 2013 - 14 when Paul missed time due to injury, finishing third in MVP voting. Now, the 26 - year - old looks as though he has elevated his game to a new level, as he is currently tied for his career high in scoring while having brought up his rebounding and percentages from last season. Brooklyn was also surging heading into Saturday\\'s matchup. The previously struggling team had won four of their last six before facing off against the Clippers. Despite this stretch of strong play, the Nets (currently holders of the second - worst record in the East) still find themselves in a troubling spot, particularly as they do not own their own pick in the 2016 draft. Despite the loss, however, Brooklyn was able to keep the game close against the Western Conference contenders. The Nets were able to take a balanced approach on offense, as all five starters scored in the teens. Power forward Thaddeus Young shone once again, posting 18 points on 9 - 16 shooting to add to what has been an impressive season for the veteran. Young\\'s shooting on the season sits at 53 percent, and his offense has been one of the bright spots of Brooklyn\\'s 2015 - 16 campaign.

In a battle between two of the best defenses in the NBA, this game was tight throughout. Despite there being just two ties and seven lead changes, neither team led by more than 12 points. The Grizzlies did their most damage in the second quarter, winning that quarter, 26 - 16. Memphis had one of their best shooting games of the season, hitting 51 percent from the field, 90 percent from the free - throw line and 42 percent from three - point range. The turnover differential was big for the Grizzlies, as they won that battle, 13 - 7. The Grizzlies (28 - 20) have struggled on offense all season long, but a 102 - point outing against the Utah Jazz is just what the doctor ordered. Zach Randolph was the catalyst, as he scored a season - high 28 points off the bench, while also grabbing nine boards. Mike Conley led the starters in scoring, tallying 23 points, three rebounds and three assists. Marc Gasol was the only other Memphis player in double figures, as he accumulated 18 points, four rebounds and five assists. The Grizzlies will be on the road for their next game on Monday against the Phoenix Suns. The Jazz (30 - 19) did have five players score at least 14 points, but the other five players combined for just 15 points in total.

While it appeared as though the Hawks were about to run away with it, boasting a double - digit lead early in the fourth quarter, the Wizards established they weren’t going to go down without a fight. After storming back to tie the game late, it was a battle till the bitter end. Down three, Washington had one final possession to tie the game and send it into overtime. Paul Pierce got the ball on the wing, dribbled to the corner and hoisted up a desperation three. It went in, and after the Wizards thought they had extended their season, further review showed that Pierce did not get off the shot in time, giving Atlanta the victory. DeMarre Carroll led the way for the Hawks, posting a team - high 25 points (9 - 14 FG, 3 - 5 3Pt) and grabbing 10 rebounds in 37 minutes. Paul Milsap was close behind, posting a double - double of his own of 20 points (7 - 20 FG, 1 - 5 3Pt) and 13 rebounds in 40 minutes. Jeff Teague was able to add 20 points of his own to go along with five rebounds and seven assists in 36 minutes. Al Horford (13) was the only other Atlanta player to score in double figures, while Kyle Korver continues to struggle in the playoffs, going 1 - of - 8 from the field and 0 - of - 7 from behind the arc and finishing with just two points in 40 minutes. After two days rest, it was clear that head coach Mike Budenholzer dominantly played his starters in an effort to close out the series while they had the chance, seeing as though their bench in total scored just 14 points, and it paid off. Now, Atlanta will head back home and begin their Eastern Conference Finals series with the Cleveland Cavaliers. As for Washington, they were led by Bradley Beal, who had been consistently great throughout the playoffs. Beal finished with 29 points (11 - 24 FG, 3 - 8 3Pt), six rebounds and three assists in 43 minutes. John Wall appeared to have put the injury bug behind him for good, as he played a game - high 44 minutes and recorded 20 points (7 - 21 FG), six rebounds and 13 assists in that time. However, the efforts of Beal and Wall were simply not enough, as the rest of the Wizards’ starters combined to score just 11 points and Kevin Seraphin was the only other player to score in double figures, posting 13 points and eight rebounds in 28 minutes off the bench.

San Antonio has been flying slightly under the radar all season due to the remarkable success of the Golden State Warriors in their very same conference. However, the gap between the two teams continues to close, with the Warriors beginning to amass a few losses and the Spurs upping their already impressive level of play even further. With Sunday's dominating win, San Antonio is now 240 at home, and have a franchise - record 11 victories by a margin of 25 points or greater. They suffocated Dallas over the last three quarters, outscoring them by a margin of 98 - 67 over that span. Additionally, they held the visitors to a mediocre 36 shooting percentage from the field, and an abysmal 26 percent from beyond the arc. Tellingly, the high score for Dallas on the night was a modest 15 points, and came from a bench player, Dwight Powell. The reserve forward added a pair of rebounds and a block to his stat line. Wesley Matthews paced the starters with 12 points, and supplemented it with a rebound and an assist. Deron Williams produced eight points, five rebounds and three assists. Chandler Parsons and Zaza Pachulia could only contribute a pair of five - point efforts, with the former also hauling in four boards, an assist and a pair of steals, and the latter pitching in with seven rebounds, an assist and a steal. Dirk Nowitzki rounded out a forgettable night for the starting five with his worst performance of the season, a four - point, five - rebound, three - assist effort that featured a 2 - for - 10 tally from the floor. The Mavericks fell to 23 - 19 and are currently tied for second place with Memphis in the Western Conference's Southwest Division. They remain home to face the Boston Celtics on Monday. San Antonio was led by LaMarcus Aldridge's 23 points, which he complemented with seven rebounds, an assist and a block. Kawhi Leonard was next in line with 15 points, four rebounds, an assist and a pair of steals. With the comfortable lead, the rest of the starters were able to play an abbreviated amount of minutes. However, Tony Parker did n't exit the game by choice, as lingering hip soreness sent him to the bench after 25 minutes on the court. The veteran point guard managed only two points, but did dish out seven assists, five rebounds and two steals during his time on the floor. Boris Diaw paced the Spurs bench with 16 points, three assists, three rebounds and a steal over a highly efficient 16 minutes. Rookie shooting guard Jonathon Simmons was also impressive in a reserve role, tallying 14 points, two rebounds, two assists and a steal over 15 minutes. The Spurs improved to 36 - 6 and remain atop the Western Conference's Southwest Division. They are off until Thursday, when they square off against the Suns in Phoenix.

The Toronto backcourt has consistently been the make - or - break factor for their success throughout the playoffs, and both Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan saved their best basketball of the playoffs for the important Game 4 of the series. The Raptors evened the series at two game apiece after falling behind to Cleveland, who took the first two games at Quicken Loans Arena, behind Lowry's leadership and DeRozan's ability to nail some extremely difficult runners, floaters and created shots off the dribble. Toronto stormed out to a double digit halftime lead after taking advantage of a pivotal second quarter that showcased hounding defense from Dwane Casey's group. The second half saw the Cavaliers make a valiant comeback, as the Raptors gave up an 18 - point lead. It started with Channing Frye, who got the hot hand from behind the arc, and followed with tremendous pick - and - roll play from LeBron James and Kyrie Irving. Richard Jefferson found himself wide open lanes to the rim and was on the receiving end of many James assists, which eventually tied the game midway through the fourth quarter.

As audiences have become accustomed to so far this NBA season, the Warriors again put on another offensive clinic. As a team, they shot an impressive 52 percent from the field and 47 percent from the three - point line, while the Hornets finished at just 37 percent from the floor and a meager 29 percent from deep. The Hornets forced the Warriors into a whopping 21 turnovers, but could n't get their shots to fall offensively and ended up taking a 17 - point loss in front of their home crowd Wednesday. It was the Stephen Curry show for the Warriors.Curry was nearly perfect with his shot, ending the night with a game - high of 40 points (14 - 18 FG, 8 - 11 3Pt, 4 - 4 FT), while also adding three rebounds and five assists. The sixth - year, reigning MVP is moving at an unbelievable pace behind the arc so far this season and has currently shot 50 percent or higher in four straight games. He's now averaging 32 points, 5 rebounds and 6 assists on the year. Curry did n't do it alone, though, as Klay Thompson added 21 points (8 - 18 FG, 4 - 10 3Pt, 1 - 2 FT) and three rebounds over 29 minutes. Thompson has picked up his production of late as well, combining for 41 points and eight rebounds over his last two games. Draymond Green struggled offensively with just four points (2 - 9 FG, 0 - 4 3Pt, 0 - 2 FT), but did a little bit of everything else with 11 rebounds, nine assists and three blocked shots. His 11 rebounds helped the Warriors secure a 53 - 41 advantage as a team on the boards. Nicolas Batum was the only Hornets' starter to get anything going. Batum went off for a team - high of 17 points (6 - 15 FG, 1 - 6 3Pt, 4 - 5 FT), to go along with eight rebounds and three steals. Batum has hit just 5 - of - 21 three - point attempts over his last three games, so his 1 - for - 6 showing Wednesday did n't give any indication of him turning things around. Jeremy Lamb, Frank Kaminsky and Spencer Hawes all reached double figures in points off the bench. Kaminsky, the rookie out of Wisconsin, led the group with 16 points, while shooting an efficient 5 - for - 8 from the field and 3 - for - 3 from beyond the arc. It was arguably the best game of his young career, with the 18 points registering as a new career - high. Lamb added 13 points (5 - 13 FG, 2 - 5 3Pt, 1 - 2 FT) and four rebounds, while Hawes recorded 12 points (5 - 9 FG, 0 - 2 3Pt, 2 - 2 FT) and five rebounds.

Memphis was without point guard Mike Conley (achilles), who added an achilles injury to an already banged up lower back and watched from the sideline, as his team was outpaced by Oklahoma City the entire evening. The Grizzlies staple is their defense, and they played strong throughout December allowing just over 92 points per game, but this was not the case against the Thunder, who found defensive breakdowns and favorable matchups right out of the gate. An offensive spark was provided from Mario Chalmers off the bench, who contributed 23 points on 8 - of - 19 shooting, to lead all Grizzlies in scoring. Zach Randolph was reserved to the bench and added 12 points and six rebounds, a less effective performance in comparison to his double - double against the Blazers on Monday. Marc Gasol finished with a lowly eight points on 2 - of - 11 shooting in 24 minutes. When Gasol scores less than 15 points, the Grizzlies struggle to find ways to win games. With the loss, Memphis falls to 6 - 14 against teams above .500 in 2015 - 2016. The Memphis Grizzlies will look to bounce back when they host the Denver Nuggets (12 - 23) on Friday. The Oklahoma City Thunder entered Wednesday with a transition heavy gameplan led by the blinding speed and athleticism of Russell Westbrook. Combine the all star guard with Kevin Durant (toe) back in the lineup, and the Grizzlies were simply outmatched on both ends of the floor. The Thunder are coming off a bad loss to the Kings as double - digit favorites on Monday, but bounced back in emphatic fashion behind Durant, who finished with 26 points, 17 rebounds, three assists, a steal and a block on 9 - of - 18 shooting, while Westbrook poured in 20 points of his own, to go along with seven rebounds and seven assists. As a unit, the Thunder shot 46 percent from the floor and 47 percent from behind the arc, and although they turned the ball over 16 times (compared to the Grizzlies eight turnovers), their ability to score and work the shot clock resulted in a blowout home win, especially at the rim. Dion Waiters added 15 points in 31 minutes off the bench and was pivotal in extending a quick first quarter lead. The Thunder will look to continue to compete for a top spot in the Western Conference when they visit the Los Angeles Lakers (8 - 28) on Friday. Table format: There are two tables.

Shooting was the difference in the game, with the Rockets shooting 51 percent, while they held the Grizzlies to just 37 percent.

After ending the third quarter down 74 - 62, the Jazz looked to have only an outside shot of securing a victory, but they were able to have a huge fourth quarter, narrowing the gap to just one point in the final minute of the game. The comeback came up just short though, as the Pacers were able to hit their free throws in the end and seal the win on the road. Indiana shot much better in this game, going 47 percent from the field and 54 percent from the three - point line, while the Jazz shot 43 percent from the floor and only 17 percent from deep. The Pacers got their biggest contribution from Roy Hibbert, who finished with 22 points (8 - 13 FG, 6 - 6 FT) and eight rebounds. He was able to use his veteran experience against the younger frontcourt of the Jazz, increasing his production from what it's been throughout the season thus far. Rodney Stuckey also had a solid game. He scored 13 points (4 - 7 FG, 1 - 1 3Pt, 4 - 4 FT) and had two steals in 20 minutes. Where the Pacers had the biggest advantage though was in their bench production. Luis Scola had a very efficient game off the bench, going 7 - for - 9 from the field and 2 - for - 2 from the free throw line to score 16 points. He's only scored 16 points or more one other time this season, so it was somewhat of a surprise performance for him. Also coming off the bench, C.J. Miles recorded 13 points (4 - 12 FG, 3 - 7 3Pt, 2 - 2 FT) and six rebounds. He continues to be very productive, as he averaged 22 points in the three games prior to this outing. The Jazz were again led by the duo of Gordon Hayward and Derrick Favors. Favors had a team - high of 27 points (10 - 16 FG, 7 - 10 FT), while also pulling in 11 rebounds as well. It was one of his best games of the season, but their was n't enough production elsewhere in order to turn his performance into a win. Hayward on the other hand did n't necessarily have his best shooting night (6 - 17 FG, 0 - 5 3Pt), but he was able to convert on 12 - of - 13 free throws, giving him 24 points at the finish. After struggling to nine points on Saturday against the Timberwolves, it was good to see him turn things back around. Dante Exum got the start at point guard and finished with 13 points (5 - 14 FG, 3 - 9 3Pt) in 29 minutes, while Rudy Gobert started at center and finished with 11 points (4 - 5 FG, 3 - 6 FT) in 29 minutes of his own.

In a tied ball game, Horford snatched down an offensive rebound with 1 seconds left and tipped in a game - winner to get Boston a much - needed win. In the next possession, he blocked a jump shot at the buzzer to seal the victory. While most statistics were even, the free - throw shooting was not. In fact, the Celtics went 16 - of - 17 from the charity stripe, while the Pistons went just 11 - of - 16. Both teams struggled from the field, with Boston shooting 40 percent and Detroit shooting 43 percent on their end. There were 19 lead changes and nine ties in a hard - fought battle. Boston (7 - 6) was missing the defensive presences of Jae Crowder and Al Horford, but both players made their returns here from a nine - game absence. Horford was the star, as he tallied 18 points, 11 rebounds, five assists and three blocks, in addition to his game - winner. Isaiah Thomas led the team in scoring, totaling 24 points, four rebounds and eight assists on 7 - of - 22 shooting. Avery Bradley was the only other Boston player in double figures, accumulating 13 points, four rebounds and three assists.

One of those assists came on a three - pointer from Marvin Williams to seal the win. Sophomore big man Frank Kaminsky, meanwhile, scored an impressive 24 points and pulled down a team - high 12 rebounds. One of the major factors for Charlotte in the win was three - point shooting, as the team shot 41 percent from beyond the arc for 16 triples.

The loss was actually fairly promising for the Lakers, as five players scored in double figures including 23 apiece for sophomore point guard D\\'Angelo Russell and third - year big man Julius Randle.

The Clippers found out earlier in the day that superstar forward Blake Griffin will be sidelined for much longer than originally anticipated, but his problematic quadriceps tendon is n't the cause. Instead, it's a broken right hand allegedly suffered during an altercation with a team employee in Toronto that will apparently keep him out 4 - 6 additional weeks. His continued absence keeps the spotlight squarely on Chris Paul, who has more often than not already served as the team's scoring leader during the time Griffin has already missed. The All-Star point guard did not disappoint in that role Tuesday, scoring a team - high 26 points and adding seven assists, six rebounds and a steal. With only J.J. Redick joining him as a starter with double - digit points, Paul's contributions were integral in a tough road victory. Redick was solid himself with 19 points, two rebounds, two assists and a steal. DeAndre Jordan cleaned up on the glass, particularly on the defensive end, tallying 19 boards, 15 which were off missed Pacers shots. He also added nine points, two assists and three blocks. Wesley Johnson paced the Clippers bench with 15 points, and supplemented it with an assist and a steal. With the victory, Los Angeles remains in second place in the Western Conference's Pacific Division. They now head to Atlanta to take on the Hawks on Wednesday. Indiana was unsurprisingly led by Paul George, who tallied 31 points, 11 rebounds, three assists, a steal and a block. Ten of those points came in the fourth quarter, when George managed to get the Pacers within their final two - point margin of defeat by draining a three - pointer with 28 seconds remaining. George Hill posted 15 points, two assists, a rebound and a steal. Ian Mahinmi returned from a three - game absence due to ankle and heel ailments to post a 12 - point, 10 - rebound double - double, which he complemented with a pair of assists and a pair of steals. Standout rookie Myles Turner managed to extend his stretch of impressive play despite Mahinmi's return, registering 16 points, six rebounds and a block over a highly efficient 18 minutes to lead the Indiana reserves.

Losers of three straight entering Saturday\\'s contest, Washington was trying to bounce back on their home court after enduring a 33 - point loss to the Celtics on Friday in which they\\'d mustered a season - low 78 points. Although their offensive output was barely any better versus the Raptors, the Wizards had ridden an outstanding defensive effort to a 68 - 62 lead entering the final quarter. During that fourth period, the Raptors benefited from the hot shooting stroke of offensive linchpin Kyle Lowry, who scored eight of his game - high 27 points during that span and helped close the deficit to a razor - thin 82 - 81 with three seconds remaining. Then, on Toronto\\'s final possession, it was DeMar DeRozan who alertly was able to feed Cory Joseph in the left corner for a game - winning three - point shot as time expired. Lowry sunk six three - pointers as part of his offensive barrage, and kicked in seven rebounds, three assists, a pair of steals and a block in a highly productive 34 minutes against the normally stout defense of John Wall. In addition to his game - winning assist, DeRozan pitched in with 23 points after a slow first half, and added three rebounds and two assists. The performance marked the third consecutive game the standout shooting guard has scored 20 points or more. The rest of the Toronto starters were notably quiet with respect to points, but Bismack Biyombo provided what was likely one of the most productive scoreless outings in NBA history by hauling in 16 boards (15 on the defensive glass), and posting four blocks, a pair of assists and a steal. Joseph paced the Raptors\\' bench with nine points, including his game - winning bucket from beyond the arc. Notably, Toronto escaped with the win despite committing 22 turnovers and having a slightly better shooting percentage from three - point range (46) than from the field (43). The Raptors improved to 11 - 6 and currently have sole posession of first place in the Eastern Conference\\'s Atlantic Divison. They head home for a date with the Phoenix Suns on Sunday.

The boards equaled a season - high for Beal, while the assists were his second - best total on the year in that category. John Wall was able to contribute 18 points and supplement it with three rebounds, five assists and three steals. Marcin Gortat pitched in with a 16 - point, 10 - rebound double - double, while Otto Porter poured in 13 points.

The Wizards\\' reserves could offer no help on this night however, with Humphries\\' four points representing the bench\\'s highest scoring output.

Karl-Anthony Towns scored 18 points (5 - 8 FG, 8 - 9 FT), grabbed 10 rebounds, dished four assists, nabbed two steals and blocked a shot.

Stephenson\\'s 24 points off the bench led the Grizzlies, and he added 11 rebounds and seven assists in a valiant effort. Memphis got double - doubles from Jeff Green (18 points, 10 rebounds) and Matt Barnes (14 points, 10 rebounds) and managed to grab an absurd 27 offensive rebounds on 56 missed shots.

Vucevic's monster contribution was necessary, as Orlando actually lost the team battle on the boards, 49 - 43. The Magic were able to squeak by with the win, though, on the basis of a superior three - point shooting night. Despite sinking only seven threes of their own, Orlando's perimeter defense was stifling, holding Phoenix to just 2 - of - 14 from three - point range. Orlando's Evan Fournier led the effort for the Magic from beyond the arc, as he sank three three - pointers on the night. Phoenix (22 - 47) has had a rough time this season, and recently shut down veteran point guard Eric Bledsoe for the season to increase the role of its young players. On Friday, that strategy seemed to work, as rookie point guard Tyler Ulis went for 19 points and eight assists in a starting role. Third-year forward T.J. Warren also continued his strong production. Warren shot 8 - of - 13 and went 10 - of - 10 from the free - throw line en route to a team - high 26 points. However, the two youngsters were not enough to propel Orlando to victory.

The Bucks have now stopped the two - longest streaks in NBA history and they did it in dominating fashion on Saturday. It was clear there was an extra fire in the building and the Warriors just couldn’t muster up enough energy in the second half of a back - to - back to keep on winning. Milwaukee outshot the Warriors 49 percent to 41 percent and made just as many threes in 12 less attempts. The Warriors played a double - overtime thriller on Friday and that really hampered them here. Golden State looked extremely tired and just didn’t have their legs underneath them, by shooting just 6 - for - 26 from three - point range. They were also outassisted 31 - 23 and that\\'s even more rare to see from this Golden State team. Steph Curry was still spectacular though, as he tallied 28 points, seven rebounds and five assists in the loss. Klay Thompson also made his return from a one - game absence and that\\'s a silver lining in a tough result. The 24 - game winning streak is over, but it\\'s time to reflect and appreciate how special of a run that actually was. Golden State wo n\\'t play again until Wednesday when they host the Phoenix Suns to start a new winning - streak. The Bucks have had a rough season, but this win could be a springboard for a needed run. This shows how good this team can be at times, but the inconsistency is just so frustrating. Four players scored at least 17 points in the win, with the high - scorer being Greg Monroe with 28. Giannis Antetokounmpo had his first career triple - double as well and it couldn’t have come at a better time. The team also combined for an incredible 31 assists on 44 made baskets and that\\'s a Warriors-esque stat.

The disappointment seemed not to carry into Tuesday, however, as the Raptors dealt a loss to the struggling Suns. Toronto\\'s All-Star backcourt - mates Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan shared Eastern Conference Player of the Month honors for January, as the duo helped lead the team to within three games of the Cavaliers for control of the East. Unsurprisingly, the tandem posted the Raptors\\' two highest scoring totals on Tuesday, with Lowry going for 26 and DeRozan scoring 22. It was an overall strong offensive showing for the Raps, as the team shot a combined 48 percent and turned the ball over just 12 times. Phoenix, meanwhile, has been in a tailspin since losing point guard Eric Bledsoe to a torn meniscus. The team has won just two of their last 22 games, and will now face the challenge of finding a new coach in addition to righting their sinking ship. One bright spot, however, has been rookie standout Devin Booker. The former Kentucky Wildcat exploded for 27 points on Tuesday, including six makes from beyond the arc.

In a battle between two stout defenses, guarding your opponent became an optional aspect of this game. Not only did both teams shoot over 50 percent from the field, both squads nearly reached the century mark to start the fourth quarter. The two teams defensive natures took over after that though, as they combined for just 38 points in the final 12 minutes. It was truly a game of swings and that\\'s evident by the box score. The Raptors won the first quarter 35 - 27 and the third quarter 40 - 28. The only reason the Celtics hung around is because they won the second quarter 35 - 21. Those are just bizarre scores from quarter - to - quarter and both coaches must\\'ve needed heavy doses of Ibuprofen after a game like this. The starting units are what made the difference for the Raptors, as they outscored the Celtics starting - five 90 - 62. This result is indicative of where this Celtics team is right now, as they are on the border of being a contender, but haven’t quite hurdled over that hump yet. Isaiah Thomas has been the teams best player this season and while he had the best night of any Boston player on Wednesday, he made two crucial turnovers late that ultimately helped the Raptors get their win. With that said, those were his only two turnovers on the night while recording a 21 - point 10 - assist double - double. The second - unit was spectacular for Boston tonight and single - handedly kept them in the game, as Kelly Olynyk, Marcus Smart and Evan Tuner all had at least six points, four rebounds and four assists in the defeat with Olynyk leading the group by dropping 18 points. This was still a good showing from this Boston team and they continue to battle elite teams in difficult environments. Up next for the Celtics is another tough task against the Chicago Bulls on Friday. Toronto has quietly been taking care of business over recent weeks and they now sit in the two - seed in the East at the midpoint of the year. Much of that has to be credited to DeMar DeRozan, who had yet another great game here. DeRozan finished with 34 points and six assists while hitting some daggers in the final minutes to cap off the win. Jonas Valanciunas also had an impressive outing, as he went 9 - for - 9 from the field to accumulate 19 points and 12 rebounds in the win. Luis Scola also put in an 18 - point, five - rebound line and he\\'s been a darkhorse hero for this team all season.

The Jazz got off to a quick start Friday, out - scoring the Nuggets 28 - 17 in the first quarter, while eventually taking a 50 - 34 lead at half. Along with the strong start, the Jazz also shot much better, going 57 percent from the field and 43 percent from the three - point line, while the Nuggets finished at just 33 percent from the floor and a meager 25 percent from deep. Despite turning the ball over 23 times, the Jazz made up for it with a 43 - 36 rebounding advantage. Leading the way for the Jazz was Derrick Favors, who went 7 - for - 10 from the field and 7 - for - 8 from the free throw line to finish with a team - high of 21 points, while adding 10 rebounds and three blocked shots as well. The double - double marked his second over his last three games, a stretch where he\\'s averaged 16 points and 10 rebounds. Coming off the bench, Trey Burke was a huge factor in the win, scoring 19 points (8 - 12 FG, 3 - 4 3Pt), to go along with four assists and four steals in 23 minutes. He continues to be a great source of points off the bench, averaging 17 points over last five games. Despite turning the ball over seven times, Gordon Hayward had a solid overall effort.

      "Text: Input text: The Minnesota Timberwolves defeated the Charlotte Hornets in overtime, 125 - 120, at Spectrum Center on Saturday. The Timberwolves (6 - 14) may have looked like somewhat easy prey to the hometown Hornets, considering they came in with a 5 - 14 record despite their solid talent. The first quarter did nothing to dissuade those beliefs, as Charlotte (11 - 9) jumped out to a 29 - 19 lead after the first 12 minutes. However, Minnesota clawed back to trail by only three, 52 - 49 by intermission. The second half was a continuous see - saw battle that appeared like it might go the Hornets' way in the closing seconds, until an Andrew Wiggins 31 - foot three - point jumper with eight seconds remaining knotted the score at 106. He then sunk a pair of clutch free throws with 11 seconds remaining in overtime to give Minnesota some crucial breathing room at 123 - 118. That five - point margin was the final separation between the two teams, as the Timberwolves secured only their third road win of the season. Wiggins totaled 29 points overall while leading the visitors, and he added four assists, a rebound and three steals. Karl-Anthony Towns was right behind him with 27 points, 15 rebounds, an assist, two blocks and a steal. Zach LaVine supplied 17 points, three assists, two rebounds, two steals and a block. Ricky Rubio managed a modest seven points but did dish out 12 assists. Nemanja Bjelica and Shabazz Muhammad led the bench with a pair of 12 - point efforts, and also totaled eight rebounds between them. The Hornets were paced by Kemba Walker, who posted 22 points, eight assists and four rebounds. Frank Kaminsky III got another start at power forward in place of Marvin Williams and tallied 21 points, nine rebounds, five assists, a steal and a block. Michael Kidd-Gilchrist registered 15 points, six rebounds and an assist. Nicolas Batum matched his point total and made it a double - double with 12 assists, while also hauling in eight rebounds, recording three steals and posting a block. Marco Belinelli led the second unit with 15 points. The Timberwolves head back home to face the San Antonio Spurs on Tuesday evening, while the Hornets travel to Dallas to face the Mavericks on Monday night.

      "Text: Input text: The Golden State Warriors took down the Cleveland Cavaliers in a whopping 110 - 77 win in Game 2 of the NBA Finals at Oracle Arena on Sunday. The Warriors now hold a 20 series lead. It has taken only 29 total points from MVP Steph Curry in the first two games for the Warriors to jump out to a big series lead. All-Star forward Draymond Green led the way on Sunday with 28 points. Green also tallied seven rebounds and five assists, making headlines for his play rather than his controversial antics after his widely - discussed issues with flagarant fouls in the Western Conference Finals. Klay Thompson also made a solid contribution for Golden State, scoring 17 points and hitting four three - pointers. Although they coughed up 20 turnovers, the Warriors were able to find a steady offensive flow, running a double - digit lead for the majority of the game. Sunday's outing was nothing but bad news for Cleveland, as All-Star Kevin Love was held to just 20 minutes after suffering a concussion diagnosis. While Love suffered injury, fellow All-Star Kyrie Irving simply struggled, scoring only 10 points and dishing just one assist. Only former MVP LeBron James managed to fill the stat sheet on Sunday, as he finished with 19 points, eight rebounds, and nine assists. It was a tough night for Cleveland in the rebounding column, as Golden State pulled down 46 boards to Cleveland's 34. The Cavs also struggled to move the ball, recording only 15 assists on the night. Game 3 will see the Cavs take their home court for the first time in the series. Table format: There are two tables.   The first table has six columns: team, losses, total points, rebounds, turnovers, and wins. There are two rows: Warriors and Cavaliers.

      "Text: Input text: The Denver Nuggets (18 - 29) handed a 117 - 113 loss to the Washington Wizards (20 - 24) on Washington Bullets throwback night at Verizon Center. After losing four of their previous five outings, the Denver Nuggets were able to turn their luck around against the sliding Washington Wizards. Small forward Danillo Gallinari paved the way for the win with a team - high 26. Meanwhile, rookie Emmanuel Mudiay showed a scoring touch with a season second - best of 20 points. Sixth man Will Barton again posted starter - like numbers off the bench, going for 15 points, three rebounds, three assists, two steals, and a block in 26 minutes of play. The team as a whole shot 51 percent from the field and hit 9 of their 18 three - point attempts. Washington also came into Thursday's matchup having lost four of their last five; however, their slide did not show signs of stopping. Despite staging somewhat of a late - game comeback, Washington was unable to lead Denver in the second half. Recently-named All-Star John Wall neared a double - double with 17 points and nine assists, but shot just 5 for 17 from the field. Washington simply could n't out - shoot the red hot Nuggets, despite holding a whopping 37 - 15 advantage on the fast break. The Nuggets will square off next against the Pacers on Sunday in Denver. Meanwhile, the Wizards will take to the road against Houston. Table format: The text contains two tables.   The first table has four columns and three rows.

The Timberwolves came out in dominating fashion, and it looked like the game was over by halftime, as Minnesota led 72 - 42 after the first 24 minutes. However, the Hawks had a quick turnaround at the start of the third quarter, and pulled within nine points by the time the final period rolled around. And despite coming back to tie the game at 105, the Timberwolves had one final run in them to pull away at the end. Andrew Wiggins led the way for Minnesota, scoring a game - high 33 points on an efficient 15 - of - 22 shooting for the field in 38 minutes. Karl-Anthony Towns also continues to impress in his rookie campaign, as he recorded his second straight double - double, finishing with 17 points and 12 rebounds in 32 minutes. Jeff Teague and Paul Millsap shined in the losing effort, scoring 24 and 22 points respectively in 35 minutes. However, the team only got a combined 28 points from the other three members of the starting lineup. Up next, the Timberwolves will head home Tuesday to take on the Hornets, while the Hawks will stay home Wednesday to play the Pelicans. Table format: There are two tables.

      "Text: Input text: The Philadelphia 76ers (15 - 50) defeated the Sacramento Kings (22 - 42) 114 - 107 on Friday at the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia. After being out - scored by 20 points in the second quarter, the Sixers had themselves in a hole, as they were down 64 - 51 at the half. They came out with a big third quarter though, where they out - scored the Kings 37 - 18 to give them just enough of a lead to secure the seven - point win in front of their home crowd. While both teams are likely going to miss the playoffs, it was still a nice win for the Sixers, who notch just their fifteenth victory of the season. The Sixers did n't have the best night shooting the ball, but they still finished at 47 percent from the field and 28 percent from the three - point line as a team. Robert Covington led the way, scoring 24 points (8 - 17 FG, 6 - 12 3Pt, 2 - 3 FT), to go along with two assists and three steals. It was the most points he's scored since the beginning of February, as he matched a season - high in hitting six three - point shots.Covington did receive some help though, as Nerlens Noel finished with 16 points (7 - 13 FG, 2 - 2 FT), 12 rebounds and a blocked shot. Noel remains inconsistent with his scoring, but continues to dominate the boards and has grabbed double - digit rebounds in seven of his last eight games. He's averaging 9 points and 8 rebounds on the season. The Sixers also got some help from the bench from rookie Jerami Grant. Grant went 5 - for - 7 from the field to score 13 points, while also adding two steals and four blocked shots in 29 minutes. He had gone a combined 1 - for - 7 from the field over his last two games, so it was good to see him get things turned around. Ish Smith added 10 points (3 - 11 FG, 0 - 2 3Pt, 4 - 6 FT), five rebounds and nine assists off the bench as well. Despite taking the loss, DeMarcus Cousins had himself a monster game. Cousins went 12 - for - 24 from the field and 15 - for - 20 from the free throw line to score a game - high of 39 points, while also grabbing 24 rebounds in the process. Cousins continues to play well of late, as this was his fifth straight double - double. Over that five - game stretch, he's averaging 25 points and 16 rebounds, as he's one of the hottest players in the league. Rudy Gay also did his best in keeping the Kings close. In 40 minutes on the court, Gay finished with 24 points (7 - 17 FG, 1 - 5 3Pt, 9 - 10 FT) and four rebounds. Like Cousins, he's played extremely well over his last five games, averaging 28 points during that span, while shooting over 40 percent in each of those matchups as well.The only other King in double figures was Derrick Williams, who came off the bench for 15 points (5 - 9 FG, 2 - 5 3Pt, 3 - 4 FT) and three rebounds in 31 minutes. The Sixers' next game will be at home against the Brooklyn Nets on Saturday, while the Kings will travel to Washington to play the Wizards on Saturday.
